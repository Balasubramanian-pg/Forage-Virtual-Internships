# Analysis and Uplifts for Enhanced Security Measures

As a governance analyst, I have undertaken the task of evaluating the effectiveness of implemented controls and proposing enhancements to fortify security measures. In light of recent challenges, my focus has been on password protection and mitigating the risks associated with potential breaches. Here is a summary of my findings and proposed uplifts:

## Password Hashing Algorithm:
The passwords are hashed using the SHA-256 algorithm. While this algorithm provides a solid foundation for password security, it's important to note that it has become susceptible to more advanced attacks due to its speed.

## Level of Protection:
The current mechanism offers a moderate level of protection. However, given the evolving landscape of cyber threats, it's imperative to raise the bar to ensure robust security.

## Proposed Controls for Enhanced Security:
1. **Salted Hashing**: Implementing salted hashing would significantly elevate the complexity of password cracking. A unique salt for each user adds an extra layer of defense against precomputed attacks.
2. **Key Stretching**: Utilizing key stretching mechanisms like bcrypt or scrypt can drastically slow down attackers' attempts to crack passwords.
3. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Enforcing MFA for critical systems can thwart unauthorized access even if passwords are compromised.

## Assessment of Password Policy:
The organization's current password policy appears to be moderately secure, but there are areas for improvement.

## Proposed Policy Adjustments:
1. **Password Length**: Increasing the minimum password length to at least 12 characters would amplify the difficulty for attackers.
2. **Complexity Requirements**: Requiring a mix of uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters would enhance password strength.
3. **Regular Password Changes**: Implementing periodic password changes (e.g., every 90 days) can mitigate long-term vulnerabilities.

In conclusion, the organization's current approach provides a reasonable level of security, but there are measures that can be adopted to bolster protection. By incorporating salted hashing, key stretching, and MFA, the organization can minimize the likelihood of breaches. Adjustments to the password policy, such as increased length, complexity requirements, and regular changes, will further fortify security measures. These recommendations align with the evolving threat landscape and aim to ensure the organization's data remains resilient in the face of potential cyber threats.
