Now assemble your project plan

Now let's assemble your project plan. This will help the team know when things will be done. The project is over 6 weeks and involves three categories: 1. Current state, 2. Design, and 3. Rollout.

For each of the 8 activities, please indicate which activity they fall under and which week they would start. You can use the structure below and write your response in the text box. Normally, you would then visualize the timeline on a PowerPoint slide.

    Create detailed designs for high-priority UX changes (2 weeks)
    Gather and analyze existing usage data (1 week)
