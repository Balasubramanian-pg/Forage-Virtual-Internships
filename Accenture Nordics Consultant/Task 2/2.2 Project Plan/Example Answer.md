Example Answer

Great work! Let's see how you should have structured your plan:

Current State:

    Gather and analyze existing usage data (1 week)
        Start Week 1
         
    Map and analyze current process (1 week)
        Start Week 1
         

Design:

    Gather best-practice website examples as design inputs (1 week)
        Start Week 1
    Develop prioritized list of potential UX changes (1 week)
        Start Week 2
    Create detailed designs for high-priority UX changes (2 weeks)
        Start Week 3
    Agree next steps for further site changes (1 week)
        Start Week 6


Rollout:

    Implement and test high-priority UX changes (2 weeks)
        Start Week 4
    Monitor UX change impacts and adjust as required (2 weeks)
        Start Week 4

Answer Explanation

    Rollout of the UX changes can begin once the design work is far enough advanced that a subset of the changes are ready to be deployed; we don't need to wait until all of the design work is fully complete.
    Existing data should be gathered during current state view work at the start of the project, to provide confirmation that changes to UX are improving the site.
    Analyzing current best practice in the market is the first design activity, and can take place in parallel with the current state view work.
    Prioritizing the potential changes is a key design activity, and needs to happen as early as possible after the team have mapped the current process and analyzed its performance and design relative to other similar sites.
    Once the potential UX changes have been analyzed and ranked, the team needs to create detailed designs for the most urgent ones before they can be implemented.
    At the end of the project, the team needs to make design recommendations for which further changes and/or ongoing work is required, so the client understands what the next steps are.
    Mapping and analyzing the current process should occur at the start of the project as part of current state view work, to allow for prioritization and changes to be determined and implemented.
    As part of the rollout, the impacts of the UX changes must be monitored so that adjustments can be made immediately if required.
