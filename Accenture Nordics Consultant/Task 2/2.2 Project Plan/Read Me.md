### **6-Week Project Plan**  

#### **Current State (Weeks 1-2)**  
1. **Map and analyze current process**  
   - *Start Week 1*  
2. **Gather and analyze existing usage data**  
   - *Start Week 1*  
3. **Gather best-practice app examples as design inputs**  
   - *Start Week 1* *(runs in parallel)*  

#### **Design (Weeks 2-4)**  
4. **Create detailed designs for high-priority UX changes**  
   - *Start Week 2* *(spans Weeks 2-3)*  
5. **Develop prioritized list of potential future UX changes**  
   - *Start Week 3* *(completed in Week 3)*  

#### **Rollout (Weeks 4-6)**  
6. **Implement and test high-priority UX changes**  
   - *Start Week 4* *(spans Weeks 4-5)*  
7. **Monitor UX change impact and adjust as required**  
   - *Start Week 5* *(spans Weeks 5-6)*  
8. **Agree next steps for further app changes**

**Key Notes:**  
- **Parallel Work:** Best-practice gathering (Weeks 1-2) overlaps with design prep.  
- **Efficiency:** All "Current State" work completes by Week 2 to accelerate design.  
- **Validation:** Weeks 5-6 focus on real-world testing and stakeholder alignment.
