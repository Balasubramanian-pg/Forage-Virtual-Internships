### **Project Plan for Digital Health App Improvement (6-Week Timeline)**  

**Priority:** *Identify and implement quick-win changes to improve the app UX*  

| **Week** | **Key Activities** | **Outputs/Deliverables** |  
|----------|---------------------|--------------------------|  
| **Week 1** | - Conduct UX audit & user feedback analysis (app reviews, support tickets) <br> - Identify top pain points & quick-win opportunities <br> - Align with security review (parallel task) | - List of prioritized UX issues <br> - Initial recommendations for quick fixes |  
| **Week 2** | - Prototype & validate UX improvements (e.g., navigation, form fields, loading times) <br> - Collaborate with dev team on feasibility & effort estimates | - Wireframes/mockups for key changes <br> - Technical feasibility assessment |  
| **Week 3** | - Implement & test quick fixes (staging environment) <br> - Conduct internal QA & gather stakeholder feedback | - Deployed UX improvements (test version) <br> - Bug/feedback log |  
| **Week 4** | - Refine based on testing feedback <br> - Begin documenting long-term recommendations (parallel task) | - Finalized quick-win updates <br> - Draft of long-term recommendations |  
| **Week 5** | - Roll out improvements to a small user group (A/B testing if possible) <br> - Monitor performance & user feedback | - Live pilot results <br> - Security review findings (if any) |  
| **Week 6** | - Full rollout of validated changes <br> - Present final report (quick wins, security insights, long-term roadmap) | - Implemented UX enhancements <br> - Final recommendations document |  

**Additional Priorities Covered:**  
- *Security vulnerabilities*: Reviewed in parallel during Weeks 1–3.  
- *Long-term fixes*: Recommendations developed iteratively (Weeks 3–6).  

**Rationale for 6-Week Timeline:**  
- Ensures thorough testing and iteration (reducing risk of rushed changes).  
- Balances quick wins with actionable insights for future work.
