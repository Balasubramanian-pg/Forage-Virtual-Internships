Task Overview
Tasks 1 and 2 will focus on: Project Priorities & Planning
What you'll learn

    How to structure a project plan to communicate to the client what's required

What you'll do

    Identify the right activities for the project
    Assemble the activities in a simple project plan

Here's some background information

Now that you've identified the top three priorities, you need to think about how you and the team can achieve them. Mikael mentioned in his voicemail that he wants to talk through your plan for this six-week project, and that he was doubtful whether a full six weeks would be necessary.

It's important that you can clearly explain the key activities which need to take place during this project in order to give Mikael confidence that you're using the time wisely. Focus on the main priority (identifying and implementing quick-win changes to improve the app UX) since the other two priorities can be covered as part of that work.

To help you visualize what the completed plan might look like, one of your colleagues has shared an equivalent plan from her own project's kick-off meeting. Her plan relates to a consumer research project in Germany and Switzerland. Although the content is not related to your work, it may give you a benchmark for layout and style.
