### Background Information

Having identified the top three priorities, the next step is to strategize with your team on how to accomplish them. Mikael, in his voicemail, expressed interest in discussing your plan for this six-week project and questioned whether the full duration would be necessary.

It is crucial to articulate the key activities that need to occur during this project to assure Mikael that the time is being used effectively. Concentrate primarily on the main priority: identifying and implementing quick-win changes to enhance the app's user experience (UX). The other two priorities can be addressed within this framework.

To assist in visualizing the final plan, a colleague has shared a project plan from her consumer research project in Germany and Switzerland. Although the content differs from your project, it can serve as a reference for layout and style.
