Example Answer

Great work! 

Here's what you should have included in your project plan:

Create detailed designs for high-priority UX changes (2 weeks)
Yes, the team needs to take the time to plan their changes, so they are rolled out in a logical sequence.

Gather and analyze existing usage data (1 week)
Yes, this is important for context and to tackle some of Mikael’s concerns with the data.

Gather best-practice app examples as design inputs (1 week)
Yes, this is worth showing and is probably a realistic time frame, if done in parallel with other work.

Develop prioritized list of potential future UX changes (1 week)
Yes, this is definitely necessary. We won't be able to do everything in just six weeks.

Agree next steps for further app changes (1 week)
Yes, it's sensible to set aside time to plan what the client may need to do after the project wraps up.

Implement and test high-priority UX changes (2 weeks)
Yes, testing and implementing the key changes is a critical activity.

Map and analyze current process (1 week)
Yes, this is a key activity. We can't recommend changes without understanding the current state.

Monitor UX change impact and adjust as required (2 weeks)
Yes, the team must monitor these and make corrections if necessary.

Here's what shouldn't be included in the plan:

Collect and analyze user insights (7 weeks)
Think again. Seven weeks is longer than the whole project duration.

Gather best-practice app examples as design inputs (4 weeks)
Good idea, but four weeks is a long time. The client will expect us to bring our own expertise so this should be quick.

Develop prioritized list of potential future UX changes (4 weeks)
Not quite - it's a sensible activity but you can't afford to take this long to do it.

Gather and analyze existing usage data (4 weeks)
Necessary, yes, but this is too long. We can't spend two-thirds of the project on the existing data.

Produce media relations strategy (2 weeks)
This could be good to do, but not needed on the plan in the beginning as we haven’t been asked to look into this aspect.

Clearing the backlog of queries and complaints relating to Digital Health (4 weeks)
No, be careful. We haven't been asked to do this and Mikael may not be happy if we include it without asking.

Identify and write new test scripts for security testing (2 week)
No, this is not within our scope and may seem unfocused to Mikael. Keep it simple!


Here are the **8 essential components** for the project, aligned with Mikael's priorities (quick-win UX improvements, security vulnerabilities, and long-term fixes):  

1. **Gather and analyze existing usage data (1 week)**  
   *(Baseline understanding of current app pain points)*  

2. **Collect and analyze user insights (7 weeks)**  
   *(Ongoing feedback to inform UX changes—spans entire project)*  

3. **Create detailed designs for high-priority UX changes (2 weeks)**  
   *(Wireframes/mockups for quick-win implementations)*  

4. **Implement and test high-priority UX changes (2 weeks)**  
   *(Staging rollout and validation of fixes)*  

5. **Monitor UX change impact and adjust as required (2 weeks)**  
   *(Post-launch refinement via A/B testing or user feedback)*  

6. **Identify and write new test scripts for security testing (2 weeks)**  
   *(Parallel security review to address vulnerabilities)*  

7. **Develop prioritized list of potential future UX changes (1 week)**  
   *(Long-term recommendations based on findings)*  

8. **Agree next steps for further app changes (1 week)**  
   *(Alignment with Mikael on roadmap post-project)*  

**Why these 8?**  
- Focuses on **quick wins** (components 1–5) while embedding **security** (6) and **long-term planning** (7–8).  
- Excludes irrelevant tasks (e.g., media strategy, backlog clearance).  
- Balances depth (e.g., user insights) with efficiency (e.g., 1-week data analysis).
