Here are the **8 essential components** for the project, aligned with Mikael's priorities (quick-win UX improvements, security vulnerabilities, and long-term fixes):  

1. **Gather and analyze existing usage data (1 week)**  
   *(Baseline understanding of current app pain points)*  

2. **Collect and analyze user insights (7 weeks)**  
   *(Ongoing feedback to inform UX changes—spans entire project)*  

3. **Create detailed designs for high-priority UX changes (2 weeks)**  
   *(Wireframes/mockups for quick-win implementations)*  

4. **Implement and test high-priority UX changes (2 weeks)**  
   *(Staging rollout and validation of fixes)*  

5. **Monitor UX change impact and adjust as required (2 weeks)**  
   *(Post-launch refinement via A/B testing or user feedback)*  

6. **Identify and write new test scripts for security testing (2 weeks)**  
   *(Parallel security review to address vulnerabilities)*  

7. **Develop prioritized list of potential future UX changes (1 week)**  
   *(Long-term recommendations based on findings)*  

8. **Agree next steps for further app changes (1 week)**  
   *(Alignment with Mikael on roadmap post-project)*  

**Why these 8?**  
- Focuses on **quick wins** (components 1–5) while embedding **security** (6) and **long-term planning** (7–8).  
- Excludes irrelevant tasks (e.g., media strategy, backlog clearance).  
- Balances depth (e.g., user insights) with efficiency (e.g., 1-week data analysis).
