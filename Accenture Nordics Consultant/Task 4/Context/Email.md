Hi there,

Apologies for the last-minute request but I'm hoping you can pull together a few insights for me to help with a Digital Health executive steering meeting tomorrow morning. I'm planning to share an update on the effects of our recent UX changes, and I have a couple of specific questions where I need your expertise.

1. Since the most recent changes went live at midnight of October 1st, how many users have accessed the app?

2. I received an email from the Support Team in Malmö – apparently their patients are having problems with the app? Can you please see if there’s a particular problem?

3. The previous booking process was time-consuming, and a lot of patients were abandoning it partway through. Are we seeing fewer “abandoned” appointments? Has the average interaction time for a successful, completed appointment booking process now dropped?

Hopefully these are pretty straightforward. If you can let me know your answers by close of business today, it'll give me what I need to prepare for tomorrow's meeting.

Thanks!
Mikael
