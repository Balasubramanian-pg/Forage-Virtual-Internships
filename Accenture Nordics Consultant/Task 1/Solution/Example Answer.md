Example Answer

Great work! Here are the top three priorities and the reason why:

Identify and implement quick-win changes to improve the app UX
Well Done! Mikael described the current UX as 'awful' in his voicemail making this activity a top priority.

Create standardized app usage reports
Yes! Mikael said the inconsistent app data is something he really wants us to take a look at.

Share best practice from other organizations
Correct! Eva's email mentioned that Mikael specifically wants us to ‘provide external best practice guidance’

Why these are not priorities:

Identify potential security vulnerabilities in the app
No. It's good to do as part of our review, but it's not been called out by Mikael as a major concern.

Develop recommendations for long-term fixes
No, Mikael was clear that he wants us to focus on the short term, so we don't want to present this as a top priority.

Develop a blockchain-based strategic solution
No, this is something Eva mentioned we should bring up later in the project, not on day one!

Introduce a chatbot to gather information from the patients prior to the appointments
No, this is beyond our agreed scope and it will not fix the critical issues at hand.

Develop a media response strategy to improve the public perception of Digital Health
No, we might address it later, but to raise it now might look like we were more concerned with PR than practicalities.

Consider doing UX changes to improve Digital Health’s website
No, this is different from what Mikael had asked and would probably make us seem unfocused.

Identify quick-win changes to improve the app UX
Not quite. We should identify them, yes, but also implement them. Mikael wants fixes, not just ideas
