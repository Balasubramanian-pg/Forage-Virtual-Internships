Briefing email from your Managing Director

Hi there,

I wanted to share a bit more background on the Digital Health project. I know we discussed it briefly already, but I’m going to be traveling overseas next week so you and the team will need to get started without me. I am confident that you’ll do a great job!

Your main contact will be Mikael Virtanen, the senior director responsible for the Digital Health program. He’s worked with us in the past and is generally very supportive and pleasant to deal with. He has high standards, though, so please make sure to double check your work :)

As I understand it, Mikael is looking for us to bring some external best practice guidance on digital healthcare. He’s under a lot of pressure after some unfavorable press coverage about performance issues and poor user experience. So, he wants us to come in and make some quick and smart changes to their app. We should also talk to him about a more strategic solution too. For example, I think blockchain could offer some great advantages here – but I haven’t mentioned that to him yet.

Just between us, I’ve heard that Mikael has also been given responsibility for clearing the backlog of queries and complaints relating to Digital Health. I don’t think his team has been told yet, and I doubt he’s very happy about it, but just bear it in mind. This might be something else we can help him with.

I gave your number to Mikael and he promised to call you by the end of the week

Thanks,
Eva
