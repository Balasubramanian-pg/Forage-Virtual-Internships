Summary of Digital Health

So you've heard from Eva and your client Mikael, now let's give you some more context about Digital Health:

    Digital Health is a European healthcare provider that allows you to consult health professionals on your smartphone or tablet, around the clock.
     
    Through disruptive digital technology, Digital Health provides easy access to healthcare for everyone at their own convenience, either through their webpage or the app.
     
    Patients can download Digital Health’s app and create a health profile. Through the app, they can make appointments, consult a doctor and receive prescriptions.
     
    The company has had a lot of negative press recently. Numerous reports have described how patients have found the app buggy, unreliable, difficult to use and prone to errors. The process for making an appointment is slow, people are being kicked off the app and it's difficult to get clarity on the bookings due to errors and/or missing information, which the Digital Health employees are struggling to cope with.
