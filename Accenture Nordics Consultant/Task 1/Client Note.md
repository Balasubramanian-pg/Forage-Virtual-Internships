Client voicemail

You get a call from the client, but you're in a meeting so he leaves a voicemail:

Hi, it’s Mikael Virtanen here. 

Eva suggested that I give you a call so we can have a chat before you guys start officially next week. I’m going to be offsite for the next couple of days, so I might just have to squeeze some information into this voicemail! The work is pretty straightforward, anyway… I just need you to take an end-to-end look at the Digital Health appointment booking process and help us to tweak it to reduce the number of drop-outs. To be frank, the current UX is pretty awful… But I don’t have the time or budget to do a proper overhaul now, so just tell me what we can fix quickly and let’s get it done. 

I’m also getting grief because our usage data is… well, let’s say it’s not good! I can’t seem to get a consistent set of data from one day to the next, so if your team could take a look at the metrics to help me tell a sensible story to my bosses, well, that’d help a lot too. Gotta go! If we don’t speak beforehand, have a good weekend and let’s catch up when you’re here on Monday morning – it’d be good to talk through your plan and whether you can accelerate any of it… Eva seemed to think you’d need six weeks, and I trust her so I’ve gone along with it for now, but it seems like a lot of time to me so… 

Anyway, doesn’t matter now, let’s discuss next week. Thanks!
