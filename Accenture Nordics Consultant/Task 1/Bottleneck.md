News article: Digital Health's eHealth Investment Gone Wrong

Despite spending 1 million euros in their efforts to be in the front-line of digital health through launching an eHealth app, it is not living up to the “critical next step forward”, as described on their website. The UX is poor, the design is boring, patients have been reporting that they cannot find available time slots, there are frequent time-outs when booking and there is disruption when trying to input information in the appointment booking process.

Anne Hansen, a former patient at Digital Health, told us: "It's stressing me out. I needed a medical appointment quick for an addition to a prescription that was running out and the app kept failing". Her comments were echoed by another patient, Oskar Borglund, who told us that "every time I attempt to make an appointment, I receive an error that says that I need to update my healthcare profile, when I have just updated it. Eventually, after four attempts, the app just logs me out. It's a waste of time".

A Digital health spokesperson said that "we are aware of a number of patients having issues with the app and are partnering with external vendors to rectify this as soon as possible. In the meantime, patients can call our office to make an appointment". Borglund was unimpressed by this suggestion, remarking "they've suggested we call the office, but there is always at least 20 minutes waiting time."
