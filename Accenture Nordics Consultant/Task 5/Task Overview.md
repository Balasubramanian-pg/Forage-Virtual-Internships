Here's some background information

As you head towards the final weeks, the team is monitoring the effects of the app UX changes and refining the design of the management information (MI) dashboard.

One of your team members, Dalia, has spotted something worrying in the data. You need to investigate urgently, but it is also important that you inform Mikael about this as soon as possible.

You have a call scheduled with the IT team in two minutes â€“ so Dalia has quickly drafted an email for you to send to Mikael. You can't afford to miss the call with IT, but the email to Mikael needs to be sent now.

Here's a summary of the situation

Dalia has spotted some worrying findings in the app data. The data shows that since the UX changes went live at the end of October 1st, the number of appointment bookings has more than doubled.

At first the team thought that the app changes had simply made it easier for patients to book appointments, but upon further examination it seems that the system has been creating duplicate incorrect appointment bookings. In short, sometimes when a patient has scheduled an appointment, the system has created two identical appointments at different dates for that person.

Since the appointment bookings are scheduled for different dates, it is not immediately easy to see whether both appointments are correct or not, since those could include follow up visits as well.

Either way, it's an awkward situation that the team needs to investigate further. You decide it's important to tell Mikael what's going on because it's better that he hears about it from you.
