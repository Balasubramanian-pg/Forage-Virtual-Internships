Great work! Highlighted in red is what you should have identified:

Hi Mikael,

As part of our work on the perfomance reporting, the team has been doing some analysis of the historicel appointment booking process. We’ve stummbled across a significant problem that I need to talk to you about.

The Digital Health app has been erronoeusly duplicating patients’ appointments, in cases where the patient is a first-time visitor to the app. For example, one patient booked an appointment with a doctor for the 18th of October, but we can see that one apointment is scheduled for the 18th and another for the 20th of October for that patient. The problem was somehow introduced by the quick-win changes that we made on September 1st.

I am not sure whether these duplicate appointments have been carried through and how many patients have realized that they are scheduled for two appointments instead of one. Additionally, I am not certain how this has impacted the timeslot availability for doctors of patients trying to book an appointment. If all new patiens are affected but only 50% realize that they need to cancel the duplicated appointment, it could mean that 33% of these appointment timeslots havebeen scheduled but not used.

While we investigate, I have spoken to the Operations team and asked him to take the functionality to register as a new patient in the app offline.

Please call me to discuss

Thanks
