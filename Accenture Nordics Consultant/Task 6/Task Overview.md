Mikael is concerned

By the time you finish your call with the IT director, Mikael has already replied to your email. Judging from the tone, he's very concerned.

Until now, your relationship with Mikael has been positive. He's responded well to the team's work and has been open and collaborative in a professional context, if a little guarded about personal matters. This issue could impact that relationship as it was not easy for him to secure the necessary approvals and funding to get support from a professional services firm to tackle the problems. In the case that we have now created additional problems – that’s not going to make anyone look good.

Let's read Mikaels email, and then think carefully about how to respond. Remember to take into account the human aspect of people’s potential reactions in high-pressure situations.

Mikael's response

Read Mikael's response, then answer the quiz questions to decide how to best respond.

Hi, thanks for the note, though it's not exactly happy reading. I wish we'd known about this earlier than now.

I'll call when I can, but I'm at a hospital appointment with my daughter for the next couple of hours and I can't just step out. Some quick thoughts in the meantime:

- Yes, let's get the app taken offline right away. Put an “under maintenance” page or something. We don't know what other issues we have.
- Where have you got this 50% figure from? What makes you think that half of the patients will recognize the duplicated appointments?
- Find Anni from the Media Relations team and ask her to stay available this afternoon. She's very helpful and we might need her help here. Let’s hope she isn’t going home early today!

I really need you to manage these messages carefully. We don’t want this information to be spread widely before we have found the root of the problem.

I don't know which of your team is responsible, but I'm not very happy with the situation at the moment. Where is Eva? I had understood that she would be working closely with us to help prevent these types of things.

Keep me updated, please. I'll check my emails whenever I can.

M
