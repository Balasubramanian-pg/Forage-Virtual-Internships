Hi there,

Thanks for all of your team's hard work on overhauling the Digital Health app appointment booking experience. The UX changes were pretty straightforward but they have made a big difference. I am grateful for your help in focusing on the most impactful items. We could have wasted a lot time otherwise!

With that in mind, I'm hoping you might be able to help me with a final piece of work before the project wraps up. We have a long list of potential further changes which we need to review and prioritize. Most of the initiatives are connected to the app, while some rather concerns the Digital Health business model. We need to cut the list down to just five initiatives and we're struggling to choose. If you have a framework or method that could enable a more scientific selection process, that would be great!

As usual, budget is a constraint: the blockchain initiative is exciting but it'll consume a large chunk of my budget, so I have just 1.3 million euros to work with for these five things. With that money, I'd also like to ensure we have a range of short-term and long-term initiatives. It's good to show ambition, but we need to show some progress on smaller projects in the meantime, too.

I've attached our current candidate list of initatives. Could you and your team work through them and let me know your recommendations and the rationale behind them?

Thanks,
Mikael
