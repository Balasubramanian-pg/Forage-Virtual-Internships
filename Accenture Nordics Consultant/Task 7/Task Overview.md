Here's some background information

The initial six-week project is now drawing to a close. The issues identified during module four have been resolved. Thankfully, the error was limited to first-time patients located in Denmark who booked an appointment through the app, which only affected five percent of the patients. All of the double bookings were “ghost bookings” and no doctor were assigned to the duplicated appointments. The client is happy that the top-priority UX changes have had a positive effect on the user experience, and that the negative publicity seems to have faded out.

Now that the most critical changes have been made, the client is starting to think about additional short- and long-term initiatives, and whether you might be able to help them to decide what to focus on next. They have a lot of ideas, but they are finding it hard to prioritize. However, with a limited budget, being able to prioritize is critical.
