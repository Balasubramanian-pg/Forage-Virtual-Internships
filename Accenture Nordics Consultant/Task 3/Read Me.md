Here's your task

You’re now into the second week of the project and the team needs to start identifying potential changes to the current website screen flows.

The team spent the first week mapping the existing screen flows, reviewing the existing app traffic/performance data, and gathering user feedback – all of which should help you identify opportunities for rapid improvements.

When working with applications you usually have access to large volumes of data. It is important to be able to identify which data that is necessary to answer your questions. Using the insights from those materials, decide which changes you believe are the strongest contenders for 'high priority' user experience (UX) changes. Try to identify relatively straightforward things to implement which are likely to have the biggest positive impact on the app experience and performance.

Download and review the resources below, then when you're ready, you can start the quiz to make decisions about elements of the current app UX.
