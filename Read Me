The "NoneType" object has no attribute "find_all" error in Python typically occurs when you are trying to call the "find_all" method on an object that is "None". This means that the object you are trying to call the method on does not exist, or it is not of the correct data type (i.e. a Beautiful Soup object).

There are a few things you can check to fix this error:

    Make sure that the object you are trying to call the "find_all" method on is not "None". You can do this by adding a check in your code to see if the object is "None" before trying to call the method.

    Make sure that the object you are trying to call the "find_all" method on is of the correct data type. The "find_all" method is only available on Beautiful Soup objects, so if you are trying to call the method on a different data type (e.g. a string or a list), it will not work.

    Verify your css selector or xpath. Make sure that the tag or class name provided to find_all() is correct and the element is present on the page.

    You can use the 'try-except' block to catch the exception, in this way you will be able to see the exact error message that caused the attribute error, thus making it easier to identify the problem.

Example:

try:
    element = soup.find_all('tag_name')
except AttributeError as e:
    print(e)

By following these steps you should be able to fix the "NoneType" object has no attribute "find_all" error and continue with your web scraping.
