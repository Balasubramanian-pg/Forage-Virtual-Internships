### **Task Overview: Analyzing the Impact of Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) on Everqlo’s Customer Experience**  

#### **Objective**  
As part of Accenture’s consulting team, you will analyze Everqlo’s **pilot BNPL implementation** to assess its early impact on customer behavior. Your goal is to extract actionable insights from transaction data and present them in a clear, structured format for leadership.  

---

### **Background**  
Everqlo, a retail e-commerce company, has introduced **BNPL** as a new payment option for a select group of customers. Since the pilot is still in its early stages, leadership wants to understand:  
- **Who is using BNPL?** (Demographics, behavior)  
- **How much does BNPL contribute to sales?** (Revenue share)  
- **What does this mean for customer experience?** (Potential trends, risks, or opportunities)  

The company has provided **order data**, which includes customer demographics (age, gender, location) and transaction details (payment method, order value).  

---

### **Key Analysis Questions**  
Your analysis should answer the following:  

1. **Customer Adoption by Age Group**  
   - Which age group uses BNPL the most?  
   - Is there a significant difference between younger vs. older customers?  

2. **BNPL’s Share of Transactions**  
   - What percentage of total sales volume comes from BNPL?  
   - How does BNPL compare to other payment methods (credit card, debit card, PayPal)?  

3. **Average Customer Profile for BNPL Users**  
   - What is the average age of BNPL customers?  
   - Are there any notable trends in gender or location?  

4. **Additional Exploratory Insights (Optional but Valuable)**  
   - Do BNPL users spend more per transaction than non-BNPL users?  
   - Is there a higher cart abandonment rate for BNPL users?  
   - Are BNPL orders more likely to be returned?

### **Expected Deliverable**  
A **single PowerPoint slide** summarizing key insights, structured as:  
- **Key Findings** (Top 3-5 data-driven takeaways)  
- **Visualizations** (Charts/graphs to support insights, e.g., age distribution, BNPL revenue share)  
- **Recommendations** (Brief next steps for Everqlo based on findings)  

#### **Slide Structure Example**  
1. **Title**: "Early Impact of BNPL on Everqlo’s Customer Behavior"  
2. **Insight 1**: "Customers aged **18-30** make up **X%** of BNPL orders."  
3. **Insight 2**: "BNPL accounts for **Y%** of total transaction value."  
4. **Insight 3**: "BNPL users have an average age of **Z**, younger than non-BNPL users (**Z+5**)."  
5. **Recommendation**: "Consider targeted BNPL marketing for younger demographics and monitor repayment behavior."

### **Data Points to Consider**  
- **Age, Gender, Location** → Segmentation analysis  
- **Order Value, Payment Method** → Revenue impact  
- **Return Rates, Cart Abandonment** → Potential risks

### **Next Steps**  
1. **Clean & analyze** the dataset (check for missing values, outliers).  
2. **Calculate metrics**:  
   - BNPL adoption rate by age group  
   - % of total sales from BNPL  
   - Average age comparison (BNPL vs. non-BNPL)  
3. **Visualize trends** (bar charts, pie charts, or tables).  
4. **Summarize insights** concisely for leadership.
