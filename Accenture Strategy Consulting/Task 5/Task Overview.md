Here is the background information on your task

Welcome back to the Accenture UK Consulting Foundations Virtual Experience Programme! After several months of working closely with Accenture, Everqlo has implemented a Buy Now Pay Later solution into their e-commerce store.

They have piloted the new payment option with a subset of their customers and now want us to deliver a short summary of the results.While the pilot has been in operation for a relatively short period of time, Everqlo leadership is really keen to understand the early impact of BNPL on their overall customer experience.

Fortunately, the wealth of analytics tools allows us to capture enormous amounts of data about users’ shopping behaviour and patterns when using digital websites and apps.

Combining and analysing different behavioural and customer data points (such as age, gender, location) can help uncover detailed and accurate insights into customer’s overall experience as well as guide Everqlo’s business and technical teams as to how to improve that experience for customers.

And that is exactly what your Accenture team lead asked you to focus on for this task: analyse shopper order data from Everqlo’s e-commerce site and draw interesting insights.  

Specifically, they want you to answer the following:

    What age group used BNPL option most?
    What is the share of transaction amount that BNPL accounted for?
    What is the average age of a customer that used a BNPL option?
