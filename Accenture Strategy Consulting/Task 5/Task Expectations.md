Part 1

    Download the Excel file provided in additional materials. The dataset contains order data from Everqloâ€™s e-commerce system. 
    Create one or more pivot tables for each question posed by the client
    To create age groups, use the following grouping settings: min.value = 18, max value = 50, interval size = 5


Part 2

    Using the data and pivot tables you have created in Part 1 and a PowerPoint slide template provided, create a bar chart that shows the share of BNPL transactions as a percentage of total transactions for each age group
    Your slide should have the following:
        A key observation/message, that can be understood without looking at the chart or comments
        A bar chart showing a bar per each age group (same groups as in Part 1) with a percentage of BNPL transactions for that age group, not total for every customer
        1-2 additional comments that support key observations or describe data in more detail.
