### **Part 1: Everqlo's Situation, Complication, and Key Question**

**Situation:** Everqlo is a well-established, mid-sized UK fashion retailer with a multi-channel presence, including physical stores, an e-commerce website, and online marketplaces. The company has historically relied on revenue from its network of retail stores.

**Complication:** Over the past year, Everqlo's profitability has been stagnant, with the company reporting losses for the last six months. This decline is largely due to a significant and lasting shift in consumer behavior toward online shopping, accelerated by the pandemic. Unlike its competitors, Everqlo has not invested heavily in its online channels, leading to a critical reliance on declining retail store sales. This situation is unsustainable and is threatening the company's long-term viability.

**Question:** How can Everqlo increase its profitability within the next 12-24 months by optimizing its multi-channel distribution strategy and improving its overall business performance?

### **Part 2: Profitability Value Tree for Everqlo**

To analyze Everqlo's profitability, we'll use a **profitability value tree** that breaks down profit into its core drivers. The tree starts with the fundamental equation: **Profit = Revenue - Costs**. We'll then decompose each of these components to identify the specific factors that are impacting Everqlo.



#### **Revenue Drivers**

The revenue side of the tree is especially important for a multi-channel retailer like Everqlo. It's not just about total revenue, but the performance of each channel.

* **Total Revenue**
    * **Retail Store Revenue:**
        * **Number of Stores:** Everqlo has a physical network, but are all stores profitable? The profitability of this channel is highly dependent on the number of stores and their individual performance.
        * **Revenue Per Store:** This can be further broken down into:
            * **Footfall:** The number of customers entering the store, which has been declining.
            * **Conversion Rate:** The percentage of visitors who make a purchase.
            * **Average Transaction Value (ATV):** The average amount spent per customer visit.
    * **E-commerce Revenue:**
        * **Website Traffic:** The number of visitors to Everqlo's website.
        * **Conversion Rate:** The percentage of website visitors who make a purchase.
        * **Average Order Value (AOV):** The average amount spent per online order.
    * **Marketplace Revenue:**
        * **Number of Units Sold:** The volume of products sold on platforms like Farfetch.
        * **Average Selling Price:** The average price of items sold on these platforms, which is influenced by commissions and fees.

#### **Cost Drivers**

Costs must be analyzed in relation to both fixed and variable expenses, with a focus on their allocation across different channels.

* **Total Costs**
    * **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):**
        * **Cost per Item:** Everqlo's purchasing costs, including materials and manufacturing.
        * **Number of Items Sold:** The volume of product sold across all channels.
    * **Operating Expenses (OpEx):**
        * **Fixed Costs:**
            * **Retail Store Leases/Rent:** A major fixed cost that is difficult to reduce in the short term, especially when footfall is low.
            * **Salaries (Head Office & Management):** Corporate overhead.
            * **Utilities & Insurance:** Fixed costs for physical and online operations.
        * **Variable Costs:**
            * **Retail Store Staff Salaries:** Staffing levels, which can be adjusted to some extent based on footfall.
            * **Digital Marketing Spend:** Costs for online advertising, SEO, and social media campaigns, which are crucial for driving e-commerce revenue.
            * **Fulfillment & Logistics:** The cost of picking, packing, and shipping online orders.
            * **E-commerce Platform Fees:** The costs associated with running the website and paying marketplace commissions.

#### **Analysis and Insights**

By breaking down profitability in this way, we can see exactly where Everqlo's problems lie. The decline in **Retail Store Revenue**, driven by a drop in **Footfall**, is a major issue. At the same time, the **Fixed Costs** associated with these stores remain high, eating into any profit generated elsewhere. While **E-commerce Revenue** may be growing, it's likely not enough to offset the losses from the physical stores. The analysis framework helps us to formulate specific initiatives, such as reducing fixed costs by renegotiating store leases, or increasing digital marketing spend to boost e-commerce traffic and conversion. The key is to find the right balance between these levers to drive overall profitability.
