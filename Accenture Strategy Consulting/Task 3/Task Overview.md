### **Key BNPL Integration Points**:
1. **Checkout Visibility**:  
   - BNPL option appears **alongside traditional methods** with clear value prop (e.g., "Split $100 into 4 interest-free payments").

2. **Seamless Provider Handoff**:  
   - For BNPL selection, redirects to provider’s secure portal for approval (<5 sec) then back to Everqlo.

3. **Post-Purchase Communication**:  
   - Everqlo’s order confirmation email **includes BNPL terms** while BNPL provider handles payment reminders.

### **Visual Flow** (Simplified):
```plaintext
[Browse] → [Add to Cart] → [Checkout]  
           ↓  
[Select Payment: BNPL/Card/Apple Pay]  
           ↓  
If BNPL: [Instant Approval] → [Confirm Installments] → [Order Complete]  
If Card/Apple Pay: [Standard Payment Flow] → [Order Complete]  
```

This keeps Everqlo’s existing journey intact while **layering in BNPL as a frictionless option**. Would you like to highlight specific UX considerations (e.g., BNPL badge on product pages)?
