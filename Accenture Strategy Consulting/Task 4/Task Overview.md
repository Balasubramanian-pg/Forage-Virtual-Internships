Here is the background information on your task

Everqlo stakeholders have a keen interest in implementing a BNPL solution. The Director of E-commerce asked the Accenture project team to develop a project plan for solution implementation.

One of the key activities in any project implementation is assembling a team with the right mix of capabilities and experience to ensure smooth delivery of the client solution.

There can be many aspects to assembling a successful project team, including defining the team requirements for: 

    functional expertise (e.g. business analysis, design, code development)  
    industry expertise (e.g. Retail, Banking industry experience)
    seniority level & experience (e.g. 10+ years of design experience)
    specific technology expertise (e.g. knowledge of Amazon Web Services)
    availability (are they booked on to other projects within Accenture?)

Each Accenture project has a team assembled based on the project and client requirements. Take a look at some of the common roles that are involved in delivery of a technology implementation project below:

    Team lead - this person drives the overall project forward and ensures it is delivered to the client successfully. A team lead is often tasked with communicating with the client frequently, understanding the project requirements, developing project plans and coordinating the work of other team members. Sometimes a Team lead can also be called Project lead / project manager, however these can be separate roles in larger projects.
    Business analyst - business analysts are an essential part of any technology project. While clients often articulate high level project requirements, business analysts really go into the detail to outline what is specifically required to be changed / delivered from a process, technology and organisational perspective. Common activities for a business analyst include: stakeholder interviews, review of existing documentation, defining existing and future processes in forms of process maps, creating requirements backlog for technical teams.
    User researcher - this role is focused on understanding the current users of a given product or service, their goals, motivations and issues related to a certain product or service. This information ensures that the project team is actively addressing those issues and develops a product that improves users’ overall experience and satisfaction.
    User experience (UX) designer - working closely with user researchers, UX designers develop overall experience of a future product, including: overall user journey, wireframes/prototypes of a future application/service, specific screens a user may interact with, sequence of user steps. Oftentimes UX designers work closely with user researchers. In some cases, these two roles may even overlap and be fulfilled by one person, if their skillset and capacity allows for that.
    Front-end developer - front-end developers write code and make decisions related to parts of a digital product that the user interacts with. This includes website design, layout, structure, animation and other aspects that a user will actually see. On the contrary, front-end developers do not usually deal with other aspects of digital products, such as databases or business logic.
    Back-end developer - this role is tasked with building out the aspects of a digital product that the user does not usually see, but is vital for the functionality of that product or service. For example, back-end developers build the application database, write code for the actual business logic required by the website or application, connect external services to the website/application, set up website hosting and many other tasks.
    Quality Assurance (QA) engineer - QA engineers are responsible for testing the digital product that is being developed and ensuring it adheres to product and technical requirements and does not have errors or issues before the product is launched to users. QA engineers are involved in writing comprehensive test plans, scheduling and performing testing activities, as well as reporting results back to the project team.


Please note that these roles can often overlap in a project setting, or not be needed at all, depending on the project requirements. In addition, there are many more project roles that have not been covered above!

Given the nature of Everqlo’s project, your Accenture project lead asked you to brush up on your knowledge of different roles and their main responsibilities.
