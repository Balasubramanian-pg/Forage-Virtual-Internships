## **BNPL Strategic Recommendation for Everqlo**  
*(Structured via Minto Pyramid Principle)*  

#### **1. Core Recommendation (Top of Pyramid)**  
**Everqlo should implement BNPL** to capitalize on growing consumer demand, particularly among younger demographics, while mitigating risks through careful provider selection and transparent customer terms.  

---

#### **2. Supporting Arguments (Middle Layer)**  
**A. Market Growth & Consumer Adoption**  
- **93.3M US users in 2024**, with Gen Z (43.4% adoption) and millennials (36.0%) as primary drivers ([eMarketer, 2024](https://www.emarketer.com)).  
- **$80.77B in 2024 BNPL spend** (+12.3% YoY), with holiday BNPL sales hitting **$16.6B in 2023** (Adobe Analytics).  
- **Competitive necessity**: Major retailers (e.g., Nike, H&M) and fintechs (Apple, PayPal) now offer BNPL.  

**B. Revenue Driver Impact**  
- **Higher conversions**: BNPL users spend **48% more on Black Friday** vs. non-users (PYMNTS).  
- **Increased AOV**: Affirm users average **$1,227/year** vs. Klarna’s $513 (eMarketer).  
- **Customer acquisition**: 70-80% of Klarna’s app sales originate from search-driven discovery.  

**C. Risks & Mitigations**  
- **Regulatory scrutiny**: CFPB may impose credit-like disclosures; partner with compliant providers (e.g., Affirm reports to credit bureaus).  
- **Debt concerns**: 1 in 3 UK users report financial strain (Barclays); implement spending limits and clear repayment terms.  

---

#### **3. Implementation Plan (Base Layer)**  
1. **Provider Selection**: Prioritize partners with:  
   - Low fees (e.g., Klarna’s interest-free installments).  
   - Omnichannel capabilities (e.g., Affirm Card for in-store).  
2. **Pilot Launch**: Test BNPL during peak shopping periods (e.g., holidays) to measure uplift.  
3. **Customer Education**: Highlight BNPL as a budgeting tool (e.g., “Split $100 into 4 interest-free payments”).  

---

#### **4. Conclusion**  
BNPL aligns with Everqlo’s digital-savvy audience and can boost key metrics (conversion, AOV). **Recommended next steps**:  
- Shortlist 2-3 BNPL providers for evaluation.  
- Develop a 3-month pilot with performance KPIs (e.g., uptake rate, repayment delinquency).
