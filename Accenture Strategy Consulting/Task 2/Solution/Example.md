Hi John, 

Hope you are well. Here is our recommendation regarding introducing a Buy Now Pay later option for Everqlo’s e-commerce store. Based on the findings, our recommendation is that Everqlo should go ahead with implementing a BNPL option. 

This method of point-of-sale finance is becoming increasingly popular with consumers and has the potential to impact several key revenue drivers for Everqlo. 

Below are the reasons why we are making this recommendation: 

    BNPL market is showing consistent growth, shaping consumer expectations when shopping online 
        Data shows that overall BNPL market CAGR is estimated to be 22.4% over the next few years
        Surveys suggest that 1 in 3 consumers in the US has used a BNPL service, whilst in the UK 67% of millennials have used such service
        Fashion & garment industry accounted for over 40% of BNPL volume, which is particularly relevant given Everqlo’s business
         
    BNPL option can help increase AOV & conversions for Everqlo
        Reports show that introducing BNPL option can increase average order value for the merchant by 45- 85%, which can significantly boost overall revenue
        Retailers implementing BNPL reported conversion rate improvements of up to 20%
         
    Majority of BNPL providers offer low upfront costs & direct integrations with popular e-commerce engines
        Majority of leading BNPL provides charge a transaction fee between 3% to 5% with low setup costs, making it an attractive to start offering BNPL at checkout
        A number of pre-built integrations exists with popular e-commerce platforms (Adobe Commerce, Shopify, BigCommerce and the likes) meaning implementation should be relatively quick 
         

Overall, looking at the 3 points above, our hypothesis is that introducing the BNPL payment option has the potential to boost e-commerce revenue for Everqlo considerably. Additionally, if successful, the same offering can be introduced in physical stores as well.
