# Forage Virtual Internships

This repo is a log of all virtual internships I've completed. Each folder contains the code, documentation, and lessons that actually matter. If you're looking for real-world exposure, minus the HR speeches and team-building activities, you're in the right place.

Virtual internships are the modern-day corporate jungle gyms — low risk, high learning, and surprisingly useful. They’re not about fetching coffee or pretending to be busy. They're about understanding how actual business problems are solved — and doing the solving.

## Task 1: Frame the Damn Business Scenario

Before you open Excel and start slapping filters on columns, stop. Ask: what the hell does the business care about?

You’re given a dataset. Your job is to figure out what’s relevant, what’s noise, and who gives a damn. CEOs care about the “where are we going and how fast” type of questions. CMOs want to know “who’s buying, why, and how do we make them buy more?”

Craft four sharp, no-BS questions for each leader. No overlap. No generic KPIs. Think like they do.

## Task 2: Narrow the Hell Down

Once you’ve framed the right questions, avoid the temptation to analyze *everything*. You're not doing data masturbation here. Focus. Trim the fat. Choose only the metrics, visuals, and segments that push the conversation forward.

## Task 3: Build Like You’ll Reuse It

Solutions should be modular, cumulative, and non-fragile. If someone wants to reuse your code, they should be able to do it without sacrificing their weekend. Build it once, build it smart. Don’t hardcode like a newbie.

## Task 4: Learn to Talk Like a Human

Your insights mean jack if you can’t explain them to a stakeholder who doesn’t care how many DAX functions you used. Your job? Make the findings impossible to ignore. Keep it actionable. Keep it business-facing. And for god’s sake, no jargon.

If you're here to learn what actually works in the data world — not just what looks good on LinkedIn — dig in.
