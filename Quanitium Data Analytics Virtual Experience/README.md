# Quantium-Data-Analytics-Virtual-Experience-Program
These tasks work through a common narrative, designed to replicate life in the Retail Analytics and Strategy team at Quantium.

## Background
Quantium has had a data partnership with a large supermarket brand for the last few years who provide transactional and customer data. You are an analyst within the Quantium analytics team and are responsible for delivering highly valued data analytics and insights to help the business make strategic decisions. 

## Context
Supermarkets will regularly change their store layouts, product selections, prices and promotions. This is to satisfy their customer’s changing needs and preferences, keep up with the increasing competition in the market or to capitalise on new opportunities. The Quantium analytics team are engaged in these processes to evaluate and analyse the performance of change and recommend whether it has been successful. 

## Learnings:

Data wrangling
Data visualization
Programming skills
Statistics

# Task 1 - Data preparation and customer analytics

Conduct analysis on your client's transaction dataset and identify customer purchasing behaviours to generate insights and provide commercial recommendations.
 Approach:
    Creating and interpreting high level summaries of the data
    Finding outliers and removing these (if applicable)
    Checking data formats and correcting (if applicable)

# Task 2 -Experimentation and uplift testing

Extend your analysis from Task 1 to help you identify benchmark stores that allow you to test the impact of the trial store layouts on customer sales.
 Findings:  
  total sales revenue
  total number of customers
  average number of transactions per customer

# Task 3 -Analytics and commercial application

Use your analytics and insights from Task 1 and 2 to prepare a report for your client, the Category Manager.
As best practice at Quantium, we like to use the “Pyramid Principles” framework when putting together a report for our clients. If you are not already familiar with this framework you can find quick introductions on by searching form them on the internet.


For this report, I included data visualisations, key callouts, insights as well as recommendations and/or next steps.
