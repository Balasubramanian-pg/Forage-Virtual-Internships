By delving into store performance metrics with statistical rigor and commercial acumen, I sought to uncover the holy grail: the store layout that maximizes revenue, customer footfall, and transaction frequency. This phase elevated my analytical prowess and strategic thinking, equipping me to make data-driven decisions with real business impact.

## Task 3 - Analytics and Commercial Application
