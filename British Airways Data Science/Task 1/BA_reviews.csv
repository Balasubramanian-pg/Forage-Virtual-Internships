0,"✅ Trip Verified | A simple story with an unfortunate outcome that really could happen to anyone. My partner and I recently started working after studying purchased two tickets to travel from London City Airport to Frankfurt. When we purchased the tickets, I mistakenly entered my name twice (e.g. Mr John Smith and Ms John Smith). Little did we know that our 1 simple mistake would cost us over 300 pounds. Upon arriving at the airport we were told there was no way to change the name (apparently they can only change 3 letters where there has been a typo?) and I had no other option to purchase the last remaining ticket if I wanted to board the flight - the price: almost seven times (!) higher than my original ticket. Zero empathy was shown. Zero alternative was offered. Trusting BA's staff and under the pretence that there was apparently no other way we could board the flight we bought this ticket. Immediately after I purchased the ticket I contacted BA's 'Commercial Change Booking Team' and informed them of our situation. The service representative apologised and told me they could have changed the name at the cost of a small fee. He offered to cancel my original ticket and issue me a partial refund then, advising me that I had a claim to the difference and I should contact Customer Support to do so. I told this person several times I wanted to claim the cost of the new ticket and even asked him explicitly if by accepting this offer, I would be denied from claiming the cost of the new ticket. He said no, I could claim the difference. Fair enough - we accepted this offer and lodged a ticket with Customer Support for the difference. Two days later, British Airways Customer Response informed us that we were unable to lodge a claim because we had 'voluntarily accepted the cancellation before the flight'. They've continued to send generic emails until this week, when they just stopped responding. So in short, British Airways misled and deceived my partner into accepting a lowball offer to waive our right to claim a refund. It keeps me up at night thinking how they can do this and get away with it so easily."
1,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flight was delayed due to the inbound flight arriving late. There was no announcement to inform of the delay nor were the sceens updated. When ready to board we were requested to take our seats quickly to help reduce the delay, which people did. The pilot then announced he had received the documents for the wrong flight from ground staff, so we had to wait while they returned to get the right paperwork. After this was resolved, the pilot announced there would be a delay as there was only two push back tractors and we had to wait again. So after rushing to sit quickly, we sat the the aircraft at the gate for nearly one hour, which is longer than the flight takes ! Of course AMS is not BAs home base and it uses contracted staff here, but it should require a better level of service, It was embarrassing hearing the pilot apologise at every step of the way. It’ll be Eurostar for me next time."
2,"Not Verified |  Fast and friendly check in (total contrast to Gatwick). The contract lounge is comfortable and spacious with a bar and pleasant staff but you have to pay for alcohol after the one free glass of wine. Food best avoided. On board, great crew and dinner was actually good quality and substantial apart from the ""chocolate and orange pot"" that seems to appear on every flight - have they bought up the global stock? The crew were always ready to top up drinks although white wine and beers were lukewarm. The crew explained that the carts are supposed to be chilled - from experience they rarely are. Is dry ice so expensive that BA can't afford it?"
3,"✅ Trip Verified |  I don't understand why British Airways is classified as a 4 star airline? The service is really mediocre. The food is untasty and insufficient for a long haul trip. Some members of the cabin crew are friendly but they are not attentive enough and create a very basic experience. This really is all about getting from point A to B without what it used to be an enjoyable trip making experience. The inflight entertainment is fairly good, but you do need to bring your own water not to get dehydrated, some snacks and ideally food and perhaps smile to yourself as otherwise you are faced with just a cold, personality less experience. "
4,"Not Verified |  I'm sure that BA have gradually made their economy experience (BA Euroflyer out of Gatwick) so miserable that passengers are tempted to upgrade to the lacklustre and overpriced business class. Long wait at the biz checkin ( due to status ) and dealt with by a bored agent - OK third party, but still representing BA - who hardly spoke and avoided eye contact and was more focussed on her fingernails. Lounge was crowded and grubby but at least the staff there are pleasant and helpful On board the seats are cramped and uncomfortable and it took over two hours before crew appeared with food sales and the ""free water"" which on Gatwick services consists of a half full plastic cup rather than the luxury of a small bottle.. A fellow passenger mentioned the delay and the fact that they had no sandwiches for sale which prompted the flight attendant to say that the service was much better on Easyjet who do two service runs etc."
5,"✅ Trip Verified |  Customer Service does not exist. One world emerald, frequent long haul flyer (including BA) - never seen such poor customer service or “computer says no”. Official BA.com site said all morning and afternoon that flight from Gatwick, delayed 2 hours. Delayed leaving for airport -only for BA to change back to original time. Called BA customer service 1.5 hours prior from highway saying situation - told not to worry, would note and flight rebooked if issue but go to airport. Got to airport 40 mins prior told could not board and that staff did not work for BA so could not help. Back on phone, 3 hours in total to be told could be rebooked, then couldn’t be, round and round. Ultimately told to file complaint. Then found out flight left 2 hours delayed. Paid for extra hotels flights with more competent airlines and now told 38 days wait for complaints to be responded to - heavens help economy and non-status flyers if that’s what the front end of the plane gets!"
6,"✅ Trip Verified | Another really great pair of flights, on time, no problems at all, champagne was ok and my meal choices were great, the new club suite is a good improvement over the previous seat, in flight entertainment could have been better, can’t wait to fly with BA again and enjoy another great experience."
7,"Not Verified |  Our A380 developed a fault taxiing to the runway - we returned to the gate only to then have the flight cancelled about 3 hours later due to a technical fault. All the while, BA staff were virtually non-existent, it was finally the captain who announced the flight was cancelled. BA provided an alternative the next day involving a connection but it was very much take this or else you were on your own. No arrangements or help made with overnight accommodation or transport,  Finally managed to get the legal minimum £520 compensation out of BA for the 26 hour delay they caused to my journey, and expenses were reimbursed too, but even this took four weeks. The fact that as a Business Class customer BA pays the minimum they can get away with says it all - they couldn't care less about customers, have no interest in loyalty and aren't bothered about your business. Given its our flights that pay BA's way, I'd suggest to anyone they take their hard earned cash to another airline who might at least care less about their customers. Not recommended. "
8,Not Verified | Horrible airline. Does not care about their customers. Used to be decent but has now since really fell off. A flight time of 5 hours and 30 mins but no meal while the flight attendants were having their eggs and sausage in the back? Didn't even offer juices. I would stick with another airline.
9,"✅ Trip Verified |  My family and I have flown mostly on British Airways for the last 30 years. I am a priority passenger and fly often enough to recognise cabin crew and know some by name. They used to be a really good airline to fly with. Things have really deteriorated with their face to face customer care since the pandemic. The aircraft look worn. For example, on my flight back my audiovisual equipment did not work and had to be reset twice, finally working in the last hour before we landed. The second time around, I think the reset was done for the whole aircraft. The touch screen function on my screen did not work. The USB charger ports on my seat did not work. The staff were pleasant enough, but their service oozed mediocrity.  There did not seem to be much pride in what they were doing. The food has been the worst part on our BA flights since the pandemic. They gave us a menu, asked what we’d like, did a check and then told us that it was not available as they had run out and would we like to choose something else. They then told us that we’d get first choice at the second service which they couldn’t deliver on. Finally after choosing and getting whatever it is that we did, the food was tasteless. We take part in post flight surveys regularly and have stated all of this, to no avail. As a family of 3, we fly British Airways medium to long haul regularly, possibly 4-6 times a year each. For us, the good things about flying BA are that we are priority customers, usually have a direct flight to our destinations and get good service on the ground, when checking in and in the lounges when we use them."
10,"✅ Trip Verified |  This has been by far the worst service I have had on a plane. It's very obvious that if you are flying economy and not a frequent traveler of British Airways, they care very little about you. We had to wait an hour for them to even open the check-in. Once they did, they had 5 lines and only one that serviced economy. Even though the line for economy was three times the length of the premium classes. Then they told economy passengers that all bags had to be check and no carryon due to a full flight and no room in the overhead compartments. Once we arrived at the gate, there were not enough seats to fit everyone and you couldn't leave the boarding area. I will never fly this airline again! "
11,"✅ Trip Verified |  In Nov 2022 I booked and paid for a return journey to New Zealand. On my return journey my final flight was from London to Edinburgh. On trying to check in I was told my ticket ‘did not exist’. I showed evidence of my flight being booked and paid for but was denied a ticket. My only option was to buy a ticket for a later flight which cost £265.07. Since Nov 22, ie, 8 months ago, I have communicated multiple times with BA in an attempt to have my money returned. They have admitted responsibility for their error which cost me £265. I finally received word from them that they have decided to refund me the sum of £32.14. I have asked for an explanation but have received none, only a polite e mail informing me that the decision was checked and was correct. I do not intend to let this matter go. A company worth billions of pounds will not return an honest refund. PS, they also lost my luggage and did nothing to help me retrieve it. I tracked it down myself a week later to Edinburgh airport and picked it up myself."
12,Not Verified | BA is not treating its premium economy passengers with respect. You pay for a premium economy service and are then compelled to use the economy toilets at the back of the plane. This is short-changing passengers. 
13,"✅ Trip Verified |  24 hours before our departure on BA059 to Cape Town from Heathrow on Thursday 29th June, we did an online check-in. Seats had already been allocated for my wife and I - 41 E and F - which are the middle two seats of the central block of four. These were totally unsuitable for us as we are in our late 70's and getting in and out of seats to stretch our legs or go the the toilet would mean climbing over a person on the aisle. But there were no other seats available. We got to Heathrow about 6 hours before departure and tried to change seats at check-in, to no avail, although the lady was very sympathetic and tried her utmost. She did offer us an upgrade to Premium Economy but at 450GBP each it was beyond our affordability. She said we should try again at the departure gate but that also failed. We spoke to a member of the flight crew who was totally unsympathetic. The economy seats are so tiny that I was jammed shoulder to shoulder between by wife and a stranger, with knees touching the seat pocket in front. For 12 hours we suffered. When we did manage to get out of our seat due to the kindness of the young lady next to me on the aisle, it was a mission trying to clamber past the reclined backrest in front of me. BA Economy is absolutely awful. The evening meal was near-inedible - both choices were spicy foods which are not very suitable when flying, especially for an older person. The breakfast Spanish Omelette was, however, not bad at all. The previous day we had flown economy from Malta to Heathrow on Malta Airlines and that 3 hour trip was a pleasure. The seats are wide and there is ample legroom. If they can do it, then why not British Airways."
14,"✅ Trip Verified |  We arrived at Heathrow at 0600 to find our flight to Ibiza was cancelled by BA with no explanation. As if that wasn’t galling enough, the customer service from BA at the airport was non-existent! There was no explanation, no apology and no assistance in finding an alternative flight. We’ve managed to find another flight from Stansted but that isn’t until much later today, thus wasting a chunk of our short trip. I simply don’t understand why BA don’t proactively contact their customers to notify them of a cancellation, and work with them to resolve the problem. Shocking customer service!"
15,✅ Trip Verified |  Original flight was cancelled with no explanation. There was no representative to help in rebooking We had to call customer service (long distance call) The line kept dropping Had to do 40 + calls to find new booking only to discover the only way I could fly the next day was by paying business class. No help with hotel for the night stay.
16,"Not Verified |  Airport check in was functionary with little warmth but some efficiency. Flight was delayed with no communication given. Boarding was chaotic and no management of the process by ground staff. Seats on board are tight and you really feel like they have crammed in every seat possible. There is next to no recline. However I was thankful that there was no recline. If the person in front had even the slightest recline they would be in my face owing to how tight the seats were spaced on this A321 aircraft. No amenities on this flight except for a toilet that was clean but small. No IFE, no food and beverage unless you pay extra but the staff were friendly. Luggage arrived at the carousel within a very short amount of time."
17,✅ Trip Verified |  Flight fine. In-line with competitors. Pleasant crew. Only niggle is bussed to and from aircraft at Heathrow. It seems like this is standard for the Berlin flights. Would use again.
18,✅ Trip Verified |  Came from Glasgow to London and took connecting flight American Airlines from London to North Carolina. It's my third day here in North Carolina and still waiting for my luggage. They didn't even bother to transfer the luggage to connecting flight. Luggage are still in Glasgow. 
19,"✅ Trip Verified |  My flight on on 12 May 2023 got delayed an hour and 25 minutes which resulted in the cancellation of our connection flight on 12 May 2023 as the arrival of the first flight was only 15 before the departure of the second connecting flight. We contacted the BA call center multiple times to make changes to the flight in order to still arrive on the 12th of May to KEF airport through different flights. The team tried to find a solution but none made sense, not even on the next day the 13th of May 2023. We have made full booking of accommodation, car rental, activities etc for the vacation in Iceland. The cancellation of of these booking is not refundable. The call center suggested that we cancel the flight for a full refund, then claim compensation for the delay and difference in airfare cost and other non refundable bookings due to the delay and cancellation of our flight. British Airways responded to the claim after a month with no compensation at all, even though we paid additional $600 on new bookings and additional charges. The refund of the cancelled flight took more than a month with multiple calla to follow up almost every week. I was promised to get refund on the first call but later I found out it was not processed properly. Every-time I call the agent ask questions about why flight was canceled etc which is annoying when my understanding everything was under process for payment. After multiple calls I was refunded partially and not the full amount which is even bizarre from a company of this level. I had to make more calls to get the remaining balance refunded. The whole experience was terrible."
20,"Not Verified |  Cairo is a 5 hour flight and BA considers it to be short haul, so everyone is crammed in with knees pressed up against the seat in front and nothing in the way of inflight entertainment. Not even a magazine - which is now available by WiFi that you have to pay for. You have to pay for your seat choice, checked in baggage, food & drink, WiFi. Not that I have anything against that - I'm used to that on budget airlines - but this is for a premium price ticket. I would have preferred to fly on easyJet where the initial ticket would have been less, and the extras would have been half the price. The BA app and website makes it really difficult to understand the extras and we ended up with baggage on the wrong ticket so had to pay extra. And don't get me started on their customer service helpline. On board the staff are ok but on the long Cairo-London route they spend most of their time on a break where they use the back row or two and talk loudly without any consideration for the passengers. And for the flyers who don't want the hassle of charges, minimal cabin service, and budget seats, then they could easily provide a 'premium economy' option  and really make a difference for the experience. Heathrow Terminal 5 compounds the poor experience, especially for arrivals. It is also poorly served by transport links - especially for those of us who live near Gatwick which is being abandoned by BA. I have been a frequent flyer for many years - and was even a BA Gold Card holder at one point - so I know about the potential experience. I used be able to make the choice - do I fly budget, or do I fly more comfortably for more? Now it's a case of flying budget, or flying budget for double the price with BA. "
21,"✅ Trip Verified |  After travelling London to Madrid with British Airways, then with Iberia from Madrid to Lima and LATAM to Cuzco, my luggage arrived 7 days after me. When attempting to collect my luggage, mine was the only one not to arrive. I sought help and was informed to make a claim online. When my bag finally arrived 7 days later, the lock had been forced open and everything inside the case searched. Someone emptied my 1st aid kit and toiletries and threw my clothing about, I felt violated. I have been treated appallingly from start to finish. For a month, I have been back and forth to British Airways, yet they stated it is not their fault. "
22,"✅ Trip Verified |  My luggage was mis-tagged in Dallas on my way to Cairo via London. My Luggage arrived at LHR as planned on Saturday 6/24. However, upon arrival due to the luggage being mis-tagged and having the incorrect name on my luggage, it was never sent to Cairo. Its sitting in Terminal 3 in LHR (I have an air tag on my luggage) and British Airways is saying there is nothing they can do about it. I have filed 3 claims, made 13 phone calls, have been hung up on 3x and as simple as it is to solve this problem the workers at BA refuse to solve the problem. "
23,"✅ Trip Verified |  The airline lost my luggage and was absolutely awful throughout the entire trip. They gave me no updates, their website sucks, and it was nearly impossible to get someone on the phone. They finally delivered my luggage to my hotel after i had left to go back to the US, 5 days after I told them to ship it back to the US. Now, I’ve been calling everyday begging them to get my bag back to me. They appease me on the phone, tell me they’re fixing it, but nothing changes. The hotel can’t get in touch with them and they haven’t even tried to pick to bag back up. Several times, when I called I got a message saying they were not answering due to too many complaints and calls and to “call back later”. "
24,"✅ Trip Verified |  We booked on the BA website, round trip flights from Seattle to Amman with a stop in London, in Business Class. Our first flight was delayed and then diverted to NYC, and enroute my husband experienced a medical emergency. When we landed in NYC we were taken to a hospital and I stayed in constant contact with the airline agent who had arranged for the ambulance transfer. The same evening we flew back home, confirming cancellation of all remaining flights with the agent at the airport. For the next several weeks, we spoke many times with BA Customer Service, trying to obtain some kind of refund — we were met with contradictory explanations, excuses and an absence of meaningful customer service. We discovered we had been marked as “no-shows” for our flight to Amman and that our return flight was still active. We were unable to cancel the return on the website, despite booking on the website. Our phone calls were never returned, we spent a minimum of 40-60 minutes on hold for every phone call we made, our emails received only canned replies without answers or explanations, we were told it was “not possible” to receive a copy of the ticketing rules and regulations nor to speak with a supervisor, and after several weeks of this abysmal customer service I filed a complaint with the FAA. In response to my complaint I received an email from BA Customer Service explaining that they had reviewed my many requests for a “full refund” but that could not be accommodated due to the ticketing rules. They would issue flight credits - except for the portion for which we no-showed. They did not state how many credits. We never once asked for a full refund - we asked to read the rules and to receive a partial refund. We will not use the credits - we were fully refunded by our travel insurance."
25,"✅ Trip Verified |  First time flying with BA business class, never again. There are no boarding drinks provided. My meal quality was below business class standards as was the quality of the wine. On arrival at Bodrum my bags were among the last to appear. Not looking forward to the same chaos on the return flight. "
26,"Not Verified | You can buy sandwiches and crisps but don't expect a hot meal. Because the plane is a narrow body , there are no screens. Not helping matters is the fact that the BA prebooking shop for food didn't recognise the flight number, and the onboard  WiFi didn't work. "
27,"✅ Trip Verified |  This is a two-for-one review covering economy and business class on the BA flight from London City to Ibiza. Economy was excellent. A very light lunch (small cheese-and-pastrami sandwich, chocolate brownie) followed by a pretty much free-flowing drinks trolley. The flight was full but the crew worked hard and did a very good job. This is a flight I would recommend. Except, don't fall for the last minute offer for an upgrade to business for £100+ in each direction, as I did. (I flew economy out and business back, while my brother flew business, then economy.) The business seats are identical to economy, with no seats blocked, so you are squished in four abreast. The meals are almost identical, with minor tweaks such as a yoghurt for your £100. The only real plus is Champagne. But on my flight, there was none because of ""supply issues"". The cabin attendant (I think his name was Tom) must be one of the best in the business. I didn't eat, so I paid £100 for nothing. Oh well. So great flight but stick with economy."
28,"✅ Trip Verified | Absolutely horrible airline. Communication is terrible. Last minute delays, cancellations, seat changes with no communication. App and website user experience is years behind other airlines. Seats are cramped and uncomfortable. Overpriced. Would not fly again."
29,"✅ Trip Verified |  Having experienced delays and cancellations departing from USA to Europe and now a 3.5 hour estimated delay at LHR heading back to USA, I would warn travelers that BA has become unreliable and is now on my “Do Not Fly” list until they get better organized. "
30,"✅ Trip Verified | Travelled to Heathrow to Kalamata and return journey 11 days later. World Traveller (aka Economy) Class. Both flights departed on time. Return flight landed early - BUT - we then had a 1 1/4 hour wait for the baggage to be offloaded which rather ruined the journey home as we then caught a motorway closure. Flights OK - FA's (particularly on return flight) pleasant enough. But, as usual, Economy class seating was truly dreadful - no legroom at all. No better in Club class either - only the middle seat left free. Marked down because of this. Can only recommend if you are not tall."
31,Not Verified |  This flight failed at every level. We were delayed and arrived at our destination late so that our prepaid car transfer phoned to advise us that he could only wait another 10 minutes for us but this was a BA holiday. We pre ordered food for our flight and this was never loaded onto our flight and to finally compound British Airways complete and utter uselessness our luggage was still in Heathrow. As there is no flight tomorrow the earliest this luggage could possible arrive is very late on Wednesday evening. Having only the clothes that you flew in and reading you can only claim for toiletries and underwear seems to be the antithesis of a happy holiday. I might have expected a complimentary scone in lieu of no food but no we were told that we could purchase from the trolley what they had available. I would like to make it clear that we are British airways bronze level holders which as we have been long retired shows how we have used this airline historically.
32,"Not Verified |  Beware of British Airways and their marketing to make you believe that they are full of class and level above the rest. They won't treat you that way when you get bumped from a flight and it is their responsibility to compensate you for their mistakes. We recently had a trip home planned from MRS to SEA. A mechanical issue meant that we departed late from MRS to LHR where we needed to make a connecting flight. We landed with plenty of time to make it to our next gate, but a series of issues and choices by British Airways kept us from boarding our next plane. The crew did not let off passengers with connecting flights first nor did they hold the next flight for a mere 5-10 minutes for passengers to make connections on their airlines. Plus, we discovered that we had actually been bumped off our next flight before we even landed. We were pushed to Virgin Atlantic to figure out how to get us home. It extended our travel day by 8 hours! We were traveling with children as well. No offers of compensation or upgrades were made. And now BA is refusing to provide us any financial compensation. We paid for a trip home with only one connection and instead had two connections, multiple airlines to deal with, security through an extra airport with kids for a midnight flight we were never planning on. That is not what we paid for but BA refuses to make it right. So beware potential travelers!"
33,✅ Trip Verified |  I flew from Cairo to Heathrow on what they call euro club class which is a cramped coach seat with the middle empty seat. Horrible service. I get to Heathrow airport 40 minutes late so I had to run around looking for my connecting flight. Finally jumping through escalators and train to another building where is my gate. Given a seat that is different than what I paid extra for ?! It’s a shame for such well known airline.
34,"Not Verified | I flew with numerous airlines, but I gotta admit, British Airways is by far the worst airline ever when it comes to customer support. I waited 3 weeks for a ticket change. Call center workers are giving you false information just so they would make you hang up. They told me I was supposed to get an email from them with the flight changes, but never got. They don't have a live chat just like American Airlines do, they don't have a online form to submit your questions, they don t have a working international number. Total garbage."
35,"✅ Trip Verified |  We were traveling as a family (5 people). Because of an accident by the airport, we arrived at the airport only 1 hour before the flight. The kiosk was unable to read one of our passports and we had to go to check-in. The lady at the check-in checked the passport and gave us a boarding pass. Because we had no extra time, we headed straight to security and didn’t realize the lady gave us a duplicated boarding pass (not of the passport holder). We got stuck in security because of that, couldn’t figure out what was wrong. We only didn’t miss the flight because we ran through the airport with a 70 year old and a 9 year old included in the party. The staff at the gate was very cordial and helpful once we arrived there."
36,✅ Trip Verified | Flight at 8.40am from DUB to LCY cancelled 1155pm night before. No text message. No phone. Waiting at bus stop and randomly checked email to see alternate flight option. Hang on? What’s this! It was dark at 5am. It was hard to see mobile phone screen. I’m still jet lagged. Only option was to LHR at 9.20am. Tried calling. No one there. So accepted it. But I didn’t see the day change! It was the next day! I didn’t want the flight (as was staying at Docklands hence choosing LCY but thought I better take it as it’s leaving an hour after the original flight. Nope. I better call to say hey sorry I screwed up. Your flight is not going to work for me. I don’t have any more accommodation in Dublin and I don’t want to waste one night in London. Called. The most surly customer service (can you even be called that when you treat people like this) answered. She kept calling me James (not my name). She was brutal. You accepted it. I can’t do anything. She basically made me feel like a moron because in a moment of confusion I accepted the first available flight from the stupid supercomputer. She kept telling me about the algorithm and this was the flight that was chosen. But if you had called us we could have put you onto a Aer Lingus flight! Why didn’t you call? You are at fault. Just so callous and uncaring. She wanted to charge me 600 pounds in new flights and change fees. I said nope and booked a flight today with Ryanair. Plus I need to find my way from Gatwick to Docklands. More money from me because of BA’s utter contempt for their passengers. I’ve been flying Qantas for 25 years and they can do some funky stuff. But never this level of cruelty because of one simple error. Never again. How do people accept such utter contempt and ineptitude? Welcome to the U.K.! Just wow.
37,✅ Trip Verified |  Terrible. I have traveled twice with them this year via business class and they have been significantly delayed or cancellations with connecting flights. The customer service or complete lack of it is appalling and has forced me to change credit cards as I no longer intend to use BA for any further flights. Terrible uncomfy old planes and miserable staff. 
38,✅ Trip Verified |  The customer service is ugly. Tried calling two weeks ago but still had problems with flight. All I get is someone in India. I thought i was flying Iberia once I looked close at ticket it was British Airways. Will never fly British Airway ever again.
39,"✅ Trip Verified |  Most uncomfortable flight I have ever experienced. It's a long time since I have flown long-haul, the cramped conditions were awful. The rows were so close together when the person in front reclined their seat my TV was so close I couldn't focus on it.  BA seem to want to make economy so uncomfortable to encourage customers to upgrade, this has not worked on me, I will avoid flying BA in future. My onward flight was with LATAM, same 787 aircraft but more room between rows, far more comfortable. On the return flight from Santiago the lights were turned down at 8pm, I feel the cabin crew do this to avoid providing a service, they just disappear behind the curtains."
40,"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked our first out of country trip to take my husband on a surprise trip to Monaco. I gave us over 3 hours for our connecting flight to and from home through Heathrow. Our flight left Seattle an hour late causing us to miss our connecting flight. We were rescheduled before we even landed. They booked us on a flight 7 hours later and offered no food tickets or any other type of reimbursement. Additionally we sat in their customer service line for an hour and a half to see if they could rebook us on an earlier flight, to watch them continually assist other customers that walked up outside of the queue (no earlier flights were available). When we arrived in Nice, France the airport was closed, including the rental car desk. We were not offered any assistance from the airline on a room or other accommodation for the night. We found a cab, which cost us 85 euros one one to get to our hotel. We thought there is no way something like this could happen on the way home….we were wrong. Our flight from Nice to Heathrow was 30 minutes late, with a 2.5 hour layover you would think we should still make our flight, unfortunately long security lines caused over 1.5 hr further delay. When arriving BA closed the doors and said they could not hold the plane any longer despite arriving 15mins before departure. After running through the Heathrow airport and going through security again. They sent us back to the customer service queue, where the first statement was we can’t get you out until tomorrow. After begging they found us a flight on another airline. At that time we were told our bags were transferred to our flight with Delta. We were given 8 pounds each for snacks at the airport for our now additional 5 hour delay. In total for our trip there and home we spent 13 hours at Heathrow airport which our original total layover of 6 hours, and we were offered 8 pound each. Unfortunately the drama continues. The two bags that they said made the Delta flight, shockingly did not. We were told that we had the file the claim with Delta, since the last part of our flight was with them. We have now been home for 5 days and each airline is pointing the finger at the other. As I said to both of them today. I don’t care who’ has my bags figure it out and send me my luggage I don't want your $500 reimbursement per bag, as that doesn’t come close to the memories and stuff that I have in there. I will never fly British Airways again, and Delta’s baggage people are not doing great either."
41,✅ Trip Verified | My husband and I booked seats within our premium economy booking. On both outward journey BA015 on 12 February and return on 11 March we were last OR almost last to be served food. Each time they had run out of our choices. On one occasion I did not eat as only available option was curry which disagrees with me. On all flights there appeared to be an undue focus on curry/spicy food. All in all very disappointing and left us with a very poor opinion of British Airways.
42,"Not Verified |  May 3, flew from Seattle to Heathrow then to Edinburgh. BA lost my golf bag which caused me to purchase golf shoes, club rentals, tees, balls. I had tee times at two courses in St. Andrews that took months to make. The promised my bag returned in 24 hours and they would reimburse occurred expenses. I contacted BA and they state they would only reimburse toiletries. Then the return flight home was randomly canceled by BA without notifying me or without notice two weeks before the scheduled flight. I contacted the corporate travel team, they informed me BA, canceled my return reservation. They rebooked me on the same flight. BA customer service was horrendous and make false promises. I will never use this airlines again. Beware of British Airways. They also randomly canceled my girlfriend and her fathers flight and they are both gold members."
43,"✅ Trip Verified | I went through three flights to reach my destination. All of my BA flights without exception were delayed, both on my way to my destination and back from my destination which is understandable to an extent. What's not understandable is that they weren't prepared for one of the flights and delayed by almost an hour so I ended up missing a flight and for that they rebooked me 24h ahead providing only accommodation which they messed up as well and after 30 hours of traveling I had to wait and hope that the hotel would find an extra room since BA didn't communicate properly with them. I gave BA a chance to correct their mistake by contacting them after the flights but all they did was answer once with a lot of serious complaints that were involved with their flights and all they did was tell me to contact their partners that I had the last flight with, which went smoothly and they had nothing to do with the previously addressed complaints. I contacted them and gave them over a week asking why they didn't address any of my complaints that their partner could have nothing to do with and they just ghosted me. 2/10 for the kind personnel that's holding this airline together though."
44,"✅ Trip Verified | An excellent flight in Club World on British Airways. The welcome aboard was warm and that continued throughout the flight. The crew were attentive, friendly and very professional. On board food for dinner and breakfast was good and there was a well chosen selection of wines. In flight entertainment offered a great selection of films and audio. The seat/flat bed was very comfortable - British Airways have done an excellent job in the design and comfort of the suites on board the A350. I liked the sleek, minimalist design. This flight showed that BA can be among the world’s best airlines."
45,"✅ Trip Verified | The flight schedule was delayed for one hour. After boarding the plane we were delayed at least another 30 minutes. When we arrived in London, we were delayed again for at least another 30 minutes to find a gate. We were left with 45 minutes only to catch our connecting flight to Barcelona, we needed to run and take the train to different terminal to catch our next connecting flight. When we arrived at Barcelona airport, we discovered that our check in luggage was still in London. Very painful trip (disrupted our vacation). Not flying with BA anymore if I can find alternative Airlines. "
46,"✅ Trip Verified | The worst experience in all my years of travel. My first flight with my two kids from Boston to London was delayed by 2 hours, resulting in me missing my connecting flight. Despite having a layover of approximately 2.5 hours, I ended up waiting until 4.30 pm to board my flight to Cairo. Unfortunately, even that flight was delayed. I would strongly advise avoiding this particular airline, even if it means paying a bit more for a different option."
47,"✅ Trip Verified |  The worst experience in all my years of travel. Bag was destroyed, flight delayed 3 hours and couldn't get water on board. Then when attempting to claim on their website the entire site failed on a dropdown menu that wouldn't work. You can't contact them. Plane was filthy and someone else's belongings and left over food was still in our seat."
48,✅ Trip Verified |  Terrible delays. Had to rebook our domestic travel for 5 passengers and haven’t received any reimbursement on the same. Lost all my luggage; received luggage after 4 days. Had to purchase new clothes for the family for a wedding. No customer service rep picks up the phone.
49,✅ Trip Verified |  A serious medical problem appeared while I was onboard. I informed the crew and they helped me out. Unfortunately I was in transit but travelling further became too difficult because of how unwell I became. Also I could not find my way back home in my condition. Thankfully the crew has helped me in every step of the journey until I returned back home. It was a stressful experience but the crew of British Airways made it way more tolerable.
50,"✅ Trip Verified |  I haven't flown British Airways before and will never fly them again! The check-in process was terrible and slow. There were over 30 people in the regular check in line and they had two agents working it. They had one agent working the first class line. It should not take that long to check people in especially when people should have checked in online ahead of time. Our group checked in online and almost missed our plane because of the slow counter service. We had to run to the gate and we did make it, but they were terrible!"
51,"Not Verified |  My itinerary was supposed to be Las Vegas-Chicago-London-Venice. When I landed in London Heathrow, I was stuck on the aircraft for 2 hours with no explanation as to why and because of such a delay I missed my connecting flight to Venice. Getting off the plane was when the real nightmare took place. Our flight had over 300 people aboard meaning many were in a rush to get to their flights or had already missed their flight. They put us into two lines, one of them being for people who missed their flight. I waited approximately 10 minutes just to come up to a clerk who told me ""Since I missed my flight I would have to go to the connecting flight BA service desks for further assistance."" If I were to have known that was the only information I would receive I would have skipped being in that line altogether. When I went to the service desk where there were more than 60+ people standing in line, I waited 30+ minutes until a clerk came by passing everyone a pamphlet telling people to create an account online and to book our flights through the BA site since their systems were down and couldn't rebook anyone. It was a hassle doing anything through he BA site so I ended up calling the helpline. After waiting to be connected to a BA rep. I spoke with a woman who said I would have to call Iberia Airlines for a rebook, I called Iberia and they said since I booked through Expedia I would have to call them. Expedia then said I would have to call BA for the rebook so when I called BA again, the rep. said the only flight he could get me booked for was for the following Monday, mind you I was travelling since the 25th which was a Friday. All the hotels in the vicinity of the airport were booked, I was trying to figure out where my checked baggage went (I still don't have it), most of the customer service I got from BA reps was horrible service as if they could care less for the predicament their company caused me. They acted like I was inconveniencing them with ""my issues"". I also had to sleep in the airport waiting for my flight the next morning because hotels were booked. Overall my experience with British Airlines has been the worst airline experience I've ever had to deal with. I will never book with this company again. I would rather pay more money for a ticket in a different airline than buy through this company again."
52,"✅ Trip Verified |  Busy day at LHR and flight full. Lounge crowded but B gates lounge quieter. Flight left on time, very professional crew, greeted by name and executive club status acknowledged and thanked for return custom. A nice touch. Service was good. Food average. Entertainment good. Early arrival, quick processing at JFK. All good."
53,"✅ Trip Verified | Worst seats I have ever encountered in economy class. No leg room at all. I had to spread my legs to fit. Staff at the terminal rude. “Business class” offers the same seat, but with more legroom and they block the middle seat. They cram people in seats with no legroom and block off the same seat type at the front of the plane (where there is more legroom) just so the “business class” passenger has an empty seat between them. Plane is old with no onboard entertainment for a 3 hours flight. Last time I will fly British Airways."
54,"Not Verified | Top Ten REASONS to not use British Airways To all: Be Aware and be on Notice- Travel at your own risk I have travelled for years on many different airlines, and I have to say that British Airways ranks as one of the top two most horrible airlines to fly. Don’t waste your time or money. Customer service is non-existent. Please be on notice that if you purchase a ticket from them and once, they have your money, you can kiss any customer service and or help resolving your issue goodbye. We used them to travel to Europe and it was the worst experience I have had with an airline in years. When you work hard and save your money to travel, you expect a good experience. Welp not with this company. Who I am sure, makes millions on customers per year. I understand that sometimes things happen, but this started right after we booked our flight AND THE BAD EXPERIENCE DID NOT END UNTIL WE SET FOOT BACK TO OUR HOMETOWN. Please take note: #1 - The customer service number is buried on the internet and not listed on their website. I had to google it and still got the run around when someone finally answered. Trust me, the number is a secret. #2 – When you FINALLY find a customer service number, there is a long wait and when or if someone answers, they will not resolve your issues. Instead, they pass the buck to whatever airlines that they sold your ticket to. NO ONE TAKES OWNERSHIP #4- What airlines operates 365 days a year and around the clock but doesn’t have customer service reps to help you, the customer? BRITISH AIRWAYS that’s who. #5 - They will cancel your flight without notice and not notify you, AT ALL. NO EMAIL, NO TEXT. #6- If you are not the primary on your ticket you will get no notifications or even if you are the primary, you may or may not get notifications. #7 - If you pay for seats and you pick them, it doesn’t matter, they will cancel your seats and not refund your money and then play stupid. #8 - The flight may be cheaper, but it is not once you are done paying for seats. #9- They will route to another partner airline and not notify you #10 – If you have a connecting flight, they will cancel one leg and not the other and NOT NOTIFY YOU. I will never use them again. And if this review helps one person that heeds my advice, then my job is done."
55,Not Verified |  Easy check in on the way to Heathrow. The flight was on time with no issues. Our return flight to Valencia was booked for the afternoon and our long haul flight arrived early at Heathrow. This was with another airline and was not a connecting flight. I asked at the British Airways check in if we could be put onto the morning flight back to Valencia to avoid seven hours waiting at Heathrow. We had our flights changed with no cost and were checked in within five minutes. That is indeed customer service. Thank you.
56,"✅ Trip Verified |  Online check in worked fine. Quick security check. Once onboard quick flight up to Glasgow, water and snack provided. All in all very pleased. Cheap, quick and efficient."
57,"✅ Trip Verified |. The BA first lounge at Terminal 5 was a  zoo at 2pm, dirty tables and used tableware everywhere. Worse than this, the usual atrocious boarding gate service, and boarding started 50 mins late. The flight was operated by a Finnair A320, which is barely low cost standard let alone business class. Hard, thin, uncomfortable seats, poor legroom and the cabin was simply tatty - I remain shocked that BA allow this, and it's time for BA's CEO and management focused on standards rather than bean counting. Finnair cabin staff were fundamentally courteous, but they provide a very trimmed down, budget airline type service, as the whole trip turned out to be - and yet this business class ticket was one of the more expensive on recent trips. I thought post Covid that BA were better for a few months, but with the many cost cuts they are making, they fall well below all other European full service Airlines. "
58,"Not Verified | Paid a quick visit to Nice yesterday from Heathrow. Decided to go Business class since my last short haul flight in Economy was a real crush and rather unpleasant. I paid over £300 for a business class round trip. I went into the to BA lounge in Terminal 5 which was very crowded. Being 6.30 in the morning I decided against having a drink and stuck to the breakfast offering. The cooked options did not look that appealing but the fresh fruit selection was very enjoyable. We subsequently discovered a much nicer BA lounge closer to the gate, B36, and waited there for 40 mins. Boarding was efficient and we got ourselves seated in 2A and 2C, seat 2B was blocked out, which acted as an additional table. There did not seem to be any difference in the width of the seat from the cramped seating in Economy but there may have been an additional inch of leg room. I think that BA are trying to outdo EasyJet in terms on no frills. It would not cost BA that much to supply Business class passengers with a complimentary newspaper to read during the flight. The inflight magazine is no longer available. There are no screens so there was zero in terms of in flight entertainment. The inflight WiFi was flaky at best and non-existent at other times. I was glad it was only a two hour flight. I really do not think the fare that we paid was worth the money"
59,"✅ Trip Verified |  Words fail to describe this last awful flight - baby across the aisle crying for most of the flight and although horrible to go without any rest for the long flight LHR/SFO, it's understandable for a baby to cry nonstop - but the crew yakking loudly in the galley even after a polite notification that their conversation could be heard in the cabin - that made the flight unbearable for any rest or sleep (always difficult anyway westbound). The food was so bad that most  turned down whatever the nasty offering was on the 2nd service. What happened to the really nice tea and scones? I've said this before after suffering through the BA concept of customer service (i.e. don't do anything to help the passenger if it involves any extra work) - this time i swear i mean it - never again on BA please! The lounge was so packed even a single traveler had a hard time finding a seat - poor BA is on the skids downhill."
60,"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely terrible experience. The app would not let me check in online and repeatedly asked for COVID documents, but then did not accept them even when provided. I was trying to fly back to the USA, where I am a citizen and the app caused repeated errors. I went to British Airways Customer Service to check in and was told that my seat was already given away to another passenger, even though I was there in plenty of time. This was also during an industrial action at Heathrow, meaning the number of flights were limited. I was delayed over 24 hours in returning to the USA, all because of their terrible app and then bad customer service that gives away seats even when the paid passenger is already there at the airport."
61,✅ Trip Verified | BA overbook every flight to maximise their income with no regard for the customer. It means you cannot check in online or at the kiosk in the airport and have to queue even with no luggage. Makes easyJet and Ryanair look like customer champions. The server in Itsu in the BA terminal says she stopped flying BA years ago due to the service being bad all the time. Most customers she serves have a complaint Staff don't care as poor service and unhappy customers is a routine occurrence.
62,"✅ Trip Verified |  
The flights were all on time, except Belfast from London which never is. The Staff were efficient. My issue is the App, I could not book seats to Tel Aviv though tried for a month as wanted to pay. So ended up in a middle seat even though a window seat was available on the flight. The seat was in front of the dividing barrier and was used as thoroughfare by the service team throughout the flight so I wasted my money on PE seat! You can get hold of BA customer service via the app either and they have just ignored all other communication so just won't use them again."
63,"Not Verified | Only the second time flying BA as first time wasn’t positive. Could have made my connection in Heathrow if BA had been proactive. Instead, overnight at the Renaissance hotel compliments of BA. Adequate, but one wonders why a large part of this hotel is devoted to sleeping and feeding of hundreds of stranded passengers. If BA had offered one employee to help us get to our gate instead of waiting for the shuttle bus which was a half hour late arriving, we could have made our flight and saved BA the cost of rebooking, hotel, shuttle, food accommodations. Another bad show. Business class fare should offer more."
64,"✅ Trip Verified | I wasn't going to bother reviewing this flight as I seem to be on a perpetual downer with BA but the airport experience convinced me otherwise. After having our flight class reduced from First to Business, then offered an alternative route on the outward leg in First to make up for the disappointment, they then reneged on this. As it was a special anniversary it sucked. Flying back we checked in online to our chosen window seats, at the gate we had to show our passports as we passport before boarding as we were hand luggage only. Trying to board we had our passports checked twice more and were issued new boarding cards for centre seats. Unbelievable! The flight itself was very quiet and only half the normal crew for this aircraft was unavailable. This meant no pre-departure drinks and a limited selection of food. The crew was great but what an earth is going on at BA, they have this unique knack to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory every time. I say this as the new club suites are great."
65,"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked business class tickets for my fiancé and I. I had to reschedule my flight due to an unforeseen timing change, so I called to get have my flight refunded. The representative on the phone informed me he wasn't sure how much I would get, as the refund department needed to check, but estimated I would lose 10-20% of my booking to fees. I accepted. I never got a cancellation email, or any update, but instead received $35 total back. Less than 1% of my booking costs. Since then I have spent over 5 hours calling different departments before they blocked me. I've lost a tremendous amount of money with nothing to show."
66,"✅ Trip Verified |  I will never travel with British Airways again. I spent over $10,000 on a business class seat to attend a funeral in the UK. First, the Boeing 787-9 cabin has 7 seats across the aisle so what you are getting in reality is premium economy. The seats are narrow and effectively are a business class seat cut in half. They have squeezed these seats in which means that some passengers bump their heads into the bulkhead when they stand up and many have to clamber over others to go to the toilet, which wakes up that passenger. The whole point about business class is that you pay to rest and have privacy and not have someone push over the top of you. Second, the food was disgusting. Third, the service terrible. Fourth, the toilet was tiny. Fifth, the inflight screen was fixed and too high so I could not see anything. Sixth, their baggage handling is also appalling meaning that my taxi was waiting for 2 hours and I had to pay more (no free airport transfers with British Airways). Seventh, the charging points did not work. The second leg to London was on a larger plane with 4 seats across the aisle. That was bearable because no hopping over people but the seat was very uncomfortable because it was not one piece. This means that you are sleeping on a metal bar (the seat) where there is a gap in the seat. To add insult to injury I now find that both flights back to Sydney are on the small plane. To book a seat before check in is $170. I paid it but note that there were only 4 seats left. This is why I got the worst seat in the house going out. This is the most appalling airline service I have ever encountered. There is no point paying for business class in British Airways. "
67,"✅ Trip Verified |  I am already in Portugal so contacted them today and they cancelled my return flight because I was 10 minutes late calling them, even though I tried for 2 hours to get through the day before. Now I am unable to get back and they have kept the 500 pounds. Customer service is shocking, they have no intention of helping you."
68,✅ Trip Verified |  Terrible. Avoid this airline. It’s now becoming regular practice to cancel flights. Had a cancellation from Switzerland that forced us to spend the whole night in a cheap hotel and had to fly out the next day and then had another cancellation to Spain. The airline only knows how to ask for expensive prices.
69,"✅ Trip Verified |  Despite being a gold member, the British Airways staff in Heathrow literally could not care in the slightest about the absolute turmoil and logistical damage or wider impact of their terrible service. All the staff members repeat the same mantra - “we are not obliged to provide even an update for the first 24 hours” as if that would make the situation better. There are no proactive updates, no empathy, no care but a lot of actual lies being told. You can tell that they have given up any care or thought for the passengers as actual individuals - they show this in every action and word they say. All of them are better suited to working away from other humans."
70,"Not Verified | Regarding the aircraft and seat: The business class seats on this flight were pretty good. All were of the suite type, where every seat has its own booth with sliding door for extra privacy. The downside to this is that if you are travelling as a couple, its quite difficult to interact. There is ample storage and USB charging ports. The seat is pretty comfortable. As someone who finds it very difficult to sleep on flights, this was one of the only times I've been able to get a few minutes sleep here and there. The amenities provided are pretty average when compared to other airlines. The leather toiletry bag was quite nice though. No slippers, only a pair of socks. The restrooms on the flight are very small, and don't provide much in the way of toiletries compared to other airlines. No free Wi-Fi in Business Class is not acceptable. Another example of BA's penny pinching in recent years. Regarding the staff and customer service: Poor. Inattentive. Beyond meal times there was offer of water during the flight. I had to go and find an attendant and ask. There was also no offer of any snacks. Rude at times. My partner asked for a fork to be replaced as the one provided was quite clearly dirty. The attendant was incredibly rude in response. This left us shocked. Different customers seem to receive a different quality of service. A customer behind me was repeatedly greeted politely by name and asked how they were, whether they needed anything etc. whereas my partner and I were not afforded the same level of personal service. This is disappointing as we paid the same price for the tickets so expect the same level of service. The food was pretty bad. I had risotto while my partner had chicken. Both were extremely over cooked and the rice looked like porridge. The vegetables were discoloured and flavourless. The bread was nice though. The breakfast wasn't much better. Summary: BA has become the Ryanair of long haul. The customer service is way below what I would expect for a premium airline in a premium seat. You pay a premium price for a very average service. If there are other options available I would choose them over BA these days."
71,"Not Verified | I travelled with British Airways from Sweden to Los Angeles via London in December 2022. When I arrived at LAX one of my bags were missing. There was no information of the whereabouts of my bag and after searching for someone for about 30 minutes, I found the point of contact and she told me my bag was left behind. I gave her my details of where I would be staying and she told me that they would contact me. After a few days and still no contact I tried to call British Airways customer service. The woman at the airport didn’t give me a file reference number, so it was quite difficult to try and locate my bag, but they finally found the reference number and my bag and said it would be delivered in a couple of days. I told them that I had switched hotels and gave them the address for where I was staying and everything was fine. But then a couple of weeks went by and my bag was still nowhere to be seen and it was time for me to fly home. At the airport I tried to talk with the personnel there to try and locate my bag and they said that it was delivered to the first hotel I stayed at, even though I had given them an updated address. I asked them what I should to since I was flying home now. The guy at the counter told me that it wasn’t his problem and that I should figure it out myself. I questioned him about his response and he just walked away. A manager saw that and came up to me and apologized for his colleague and that they would send someone to fetch my bag and send it with either my flight or the next one. I came home and a couple of days later I received my bag. I made a complaint and claims on British Airways website since I had to buy clothes and toiletries during my vacation because I didn’t have my bag. In January they said that they would refund me for my claims, it is now April (almost May) and I have still not received the refund even after multiple email conversations. I don’t know what to do anymore about this situation since it appears that no one is willing to help me. I am appalled about how the situation is being handled and frankly disappointed at British Airways and the lack of customer service."
72,"Not Verified |  Food was lousy. Who ever is planning the Asian Hindu Vegetarian meal is clueless as to what this meal includes. The snack was also lousy. It took us 2 hours just to go from T5 to T3 and clear security check. The place was chaotic. We get to our boarding gate and again a long line with 40 minutes wait for someone to check passport and boarding pass. Seats in Premium economy was ok, but when the passenger in front reclines, there is very little space for the window seat passenger to cross over. Overall not a good airline."
73,"✅ Trip Verified | Had the worst experience. The flight from London to Toronto got delayed and we missed the connecting flight to Halifax. We were four including an infant and a toddler aged 4 years, despite being delayed and missed the connecting flight the ground staff were not at all helpful. We waited for an hour to get them to talk to us and at 12 am they told us they have not booked any hotel for us to stay that night and asked to go search for a hotel on your own, very nice of you British Airways. At least you guys should have given some consideration to the travelers who travel with children and booked some accommodation. We will NOT to travel on this airline again."
74,✅ Trip Verified |  The ground staff were not helpful. Felt like all they wanted to do was rush us to check in and then all passengers needed up waiting in a holding area for a bus anyway. Travelling with a child with a disability was a nightmare with British Airways. Logged a complaint and it took almost four weeks to answer. Lost some of our luggage. It was not a good experience.
75,"✅ Trip Verified |  Second time BA Premium Economy in a newer aircraft and yet another excellent experience. Despite a three hour delay and missing my connection in Hong Kong, this was a very pleasant flight. Seats are spacious and comfortable in Premium Economy in this layout, attitude of the cabin crew was excellent and food was good. They communicate well and rebooked my connection during the flight which brought peace of mind. A very pleasant experience in BA Premium Economy after a major disappointment in Club World earlier this year."
76,"Not Verified |  They changed our Flights from Brussels to London Heathrow to LAX on 4/16/2023. We paid extra to choose our seats. Since they cancelled they never honored the seat that we bought, they seated us in totally different seats. I asked the check in employee, she was very rude and told us that we have to understand that was a different flight. From London to LAX was worse, nobody in the airport help us. Employees from BA told us that we have to return next day for our flight we can rent a hotel or go terminal 3 and sleep there. Finally one employee help us and gives a voucher for hotel. It was a nightmare this airline. We missed one day work and BA didn’t return the money that we paid for our previous chosen seats."
77,"Not Verified |  At Copenhagen the most chaotic ticket counter assignment in the history of airlines. Time on board never changed, no fixed counter at Airport. Abysmal service that needs vast improvement here"
78,✅ Trip Verified |  Worst experience of my life trying to deal with the customer service for British Airways. So many issues with getting from one destination to the other. Had an absolutely horrible time trying to get answers or reach anyone who was capable of helping navigate uncertainties. I wrote them a formal complaint requesting some type of refund and received a generic “we are sorry” email with 5000 avios attached which is equivalent to maybe $50 on a $600+ flight. Needless to say these will go to waste as I refuse to fly with an untrustworthy incompetent unorganized airline that couldn’t even address one single issue expressed to them. It was equivalent to handing me a band aid after slapping me in the face. I will say the flight itself was smooth and the onboard staff was kind and attentive. The most frustrating thing is that the customer service is trained to give you the runaround so heavily to the point of exhaustion that you just give up trying and take the loss.
79,"✅ Trip Verified |  Due to code sharing with Cathay Pacific I was downgraded to BA on my return leg. I can’t describe how cheated I felt. I booked and paid for an airline with great entertainment, food and service, instead, I was forced to go hungry because they only had one choice of meal and it was inedible. To ensure the passengers didn’t get any funny ideas and assume that as the vegetarian option was unavailable they might be given a cracker or a small packet of nuts. The cabin crew announced in their uniquely aggressive and dismissive way “You won’t get anything else for 12 hours you know!” the entertainment is compiled mainly of B movies so I paid £11 for Wi-Fi so I could watch Netflix on my laptop. Unsurprisingly, the signal was so weak I couldn’t even send an email. To add insult to injury, the earbuds provided the cheapest and lowest quality I have ever seen. Since the last time I used this airline the crew are less rude and obnoxious and are now just impatient and unhelpful.  What I don’t understand is why it seems that British Airways look for these characteristics as desirable attributes for their crew. "
80,"✅ Trip Verified |  LHR check in was quick at the First Wing and quickly through security. The First lounge was quiet for a change and a reasonably good breakfast buffet available. While BA have brought back their Highlife magazine in the lounge, it seems they used Covid to scrap all the other magazines they used to offer, as part of the endless BA cost cutting. The toilets in the lounge were as disgusting as ever, not cleaned frequently on this visit and they are about 20 years out of date (the public washrooms in T5 are better and cleaner). Boarding was the usual BA muddled mess, and two of the gate staff appeared to have no clue what they were doing. Endless announcements at the gate about being a full flight, requesting passengers to check in bags, only to get on a flight that was less than 40% full. Onboard a very good welcome from Captain and the flight left the gate only 5 mins late. Breakfast had 3 choices and was a fair standard. No hot towels or even packet towels offered in Club Europe any more, another part of the relentless BA cost cutting. I wouldn't mind but fares are proportionately a lot higher now than pre Covid. Cabin staff service was perfunctory at best, not a scrap of recognition for BA Gold or Oneworld Emerald members, clear proof that BA really don't care any more. Breakfast trays cleared 45 mins into the flight, and that was the sign for staff to stay in the front galley for the rest of the flight. Paid £4.99 for 1 hours wifi, and dropped connection for the next 40 mins. Sad to note that staff service on Ryanair is more pro active nowadays. Priority tagged suitcase came out nearly last at Malaga, this is standard for BA business class baggage handling. Do not waste your money on Club Europe, standards just keep dropping. "
81,"✅ Trip Verified |  I wouldn't recommend British Airways at all. I tried to call to customer service for 3 times in different days and time and I waited for more than 30 minutes on the phone! I ended hanging up. They are excusing themselves in the high volume of calls. I write an email an I am still waiting for 2 weeks!  Website is difficult to navigate. It is not easy really to have an invoice of proof of receipt or look for another service. They sent you online but you don't receive a PDF file. So if you need a proof of flight, you need to do screenshots. And, once the flight is flown, you have no access to that booking again to reprint any document or try to create a PDF. You need to contact with a customer service which I did it online, long waiting time, and had to wait more than a week to receive it. Expensive and poor, almost inexistent customer service and difficult to use their website. An airline that definitely wouldn't recommend. It is such a shame that in 2023 they are still in this position and sleeping when they have competitors around"
82,"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely horrible experience. I booked a ticket from Expedia for a British Airways Operated flight from Madrid to Belfast with a changeover at London Heathrow. The whole itinerary was listed as BA although the Madrid to London flight was Iberia. On Jan 22nd, London was experiencing cold and fog. The Iberian flight sat on the tarmac for 2 hours in Madrid because of the London weather. Upon landing in Terminal 3, I had to take a bus to Terminal 5. The flight was the last flight to Belfast for the evening and it had already taken off. The BA desk was swamped with people as many people had to spend the night due to the weather. The British Airways staff said that we could go book any hotel up to 200 pounds and we would be reimbursed. I was barely able to find a room and had to take an expensive cab. However when trying to get the reimbursement, BA said it wasn't their problem and that it was Iberia's problem. Iberia said they do not reimburse due to the weather. When complaining to BA, they said they only market the flight as BA and that they refuse to reimburse. Absolutely disgusting behavior by the airline to not take any responsibility for a flight that they were using their name to sell it to people but don't want to take responsibility for it. Did they expect me to take the bus back to Terminal 3? Their people gave out false information."
83,"Not Verified |  This is the worst airline. Not one thing went right. I don’t understand how they have got it so bad. Late take off, no gate when we arrived. Bags took over 40 minutes to arrive. Horrendous"
84,"✅ Trip Verified |  I will never fly British Airways again. To start, the plane was over 2 hours late, with no weather and no reason given. The boarding process was chaotic, both in the airport and onto the plane. But more importantly, although we were in business class, it wasn’t really business class. There were a few aisles —not separated in any way—in which they simply put a tray on the middle seat so that no one sits there. And those seats, like the rest, were extremely cramped and uncomfortable. I could not believe they called this business class."
85,✅ Trip Verified |  Worst aircraft I have ever flown. The seats were cramped and uncomfortable considering the flights cost well over &1000each we expected a little space for the money my husbands knees were rubbing on seat in front which for a 10 hour+ flight is not acceptable. My food was disgusting and inedible both the hot food and the breakfast were vile. I would not entertain using BA again. Ground staff were great it’s the seating and food on offer that lets the airline down. We expected so much more.
86,"✅ Trip Verified |  I enjoyed my flight. The boarding was swift and service was very friendly and professional. The food selection was good and I enjoyed the quality. The was only one downside - when we landed there was an issue with ground crew not being ready at T5, so in total from landing to getting the doors open it took 30 minutes. I believe the Heathrow T5 were having strike action that week."
87,"✅ Trip Verified | Why do you make it so hard? After a so so lounge experience, the staff taking care of boarding treated us with disdain bordering contempt. It can’t be training, who would do that, it has to be no fear of anything happening. The “new” club world suites are a huge step up from the old product and really on deliver comfort and privacy. The crew were professional but I personally found the food menu rather odd. Essentially, there was one only main that I could handle and was then told they had ran out. I was a few rows in. "
88,"✅ Trip Verified |  After several delays and canceled flights, we finally made it to Copenhagen on American Airlines and British Airways flights. My luggage was destroyed, wheels torn off. I had to buy new luggage in Denmark. I made a claim with British Airways to reimburse me but because I didn’t have the receipt for my old luggage, they would only cover 50% of my new luggage. Advice, have receipts for your old luggage prior to flying so you don’t get ripped off like I did."
89,"Not Verified |  Literally the worst flight of my life. After booking tickets together with my partner, we were then separated: ‘sorry, the flight is full.’ The flight then took off 45 minutes late - no apology. The trolley service took over two hours and they periodically skipped rows, and the response was flippant and rude: ‘whoops. Not sure how that happened. What do you want?’ Genuinely appalling from beginning to end. Might as well fly Easy Jet - at least they charge a price commensurate with the poor quality of service, not like BA"
90,"✅ Trip Verified |  I swore I would never fly BA again after they messed me about so much when trying to get to Budapest. But the times for their flights suited me so I decided to give them another go. The flight left on time (just about), the cabin was clean and the staff friendly. There was even complimentary tea/coffee and a breakfast bar to be had for economy. The flight was pleasant enough and I can't think of any negatives to write about. The flight and service was certainly head and shoulders above my trip with easyjet."
91,"✅ Trip Verified |  Obviously many airlines have gone downhill in recent years. Prices have increased and services have gone down. The most disappointing thing about BA is that aspects that really don’t need to get worse have. The check in staff at Heathrow are downright rude and abusive, shouting at passengers to line here and there and rolling their eyes if passengers get confused with the constant shouting and bullying. Airlines are now competing globally more and more and this behaviour is particularly noticeable in Asia where the service industry is next level. I wouldn’t want to suggest that all the staff are like this and many younger employees are polite and helpful. However there were a couple of older staff that were downright rude and obnoxious. "
92,"✅ Trip Verified | Lost 3 out of 4 checked bags. Denied wheelchair assistance at LHR for my wife and the staff forced us to change terminals by foot. Rude staff on BA297 from LHR to ORD on April 05, 2023: ignored multiple times when simply requested a cup of water. When walked up to them after a couple of attempts to request for water politely, the BA staff onboard yelled at my wife and asked her to be go back to seat. Horrible flight with disappointing staff. Customer service is terrible and online check-in never worked because BA never verified our COVID documents which were uploaded in advance, resulting me and my wife seated separately. I’ve lost respect for British Airways. Disgusted."
93,"✅ Trip Verified |  I have flown with BA for many years and there was a time about 10 years ago when they were getting better. Sadly this trip underlines how they have slipped versus other airlines. At booking time, one is scammed an extortionate amount to book a seat. At Heathrow T5 check in the queues were unbelievably long and staff at bag drop curt to say the least. The lounges here remain awful and overcrowded and BA has not invested in them for many years. On the flight the food was okay, although portions are kept minimal. This was one of those days when the crew could not give a damn and the service was mostly absent for the entire flight. Next time they change CEO, can they not do better than recruiting from aa second rate, budget Irish airline."
94,"✅ Trip Verified | Boarding at Mumbai was chaotic and badly organised. Once on board the crew announcements were professional, relaxed and informative in typical BA style. The seat was quite comfortable. It was a refurbished aircraft and the padding and materials are quite good. I was lucky that the middle seat was empty so I didn’t suffer from the new narrow seat which I think would have made it a lot less comfortable. The IFE is excellent, responsive and good quality. There is an enormous selection of TV and movies and a good number of games. WIFI is also very good not quite Netflix quality but still reasonable and I don’t think £17.99 for full flight is bad value. You can pay less if you just want short term simple messaging. Cabin crew were very good. Friendly and efficient. Catering was reasonable although on a near 10hr flight, the small (but tasty) pastry for the second meal service wasn’t really enough. Landing and processing at Heathrow was astonishingly quick - it felt like it was 3am, even though it was 6:30pm! No queues or waiting at all. Even the baggage was super quick at coming through. Overall a very solid experience in economy. Significantly better than it used to be."
95,"Not Verified | Mexico City Airport is a zoo, but taking the late departure on BA to LHR isn't too bad. Club passengers can use the AA Admirals Lounge, which is surprisingly good and not too busy as it seems to cater to BA's club passengers only at this time of day. Lovely staff, solid food & bar, really pleasant. We flew an older 787 with the old style club seats. Seated in the front cabin (just 3 rows of club) in the window and adjecant aisle seat is really good if you travel with your partner. Come to think of it, I will really miss this old style -once cutting edge- lay-out. There is no better way to fly when you are a couple. We were in that last row of the front cabin so both window and aisle seat had unobstructed access to the aisle. Still terrible you have to pay for these seats, but it obvioulsy works and we were happy getting these seats. Flying BA when the crew is good is amazing. Service was impecable on this flight. Just the right mix of humor, service and attention. Food seemed to be good as well, but hardly touched it. I am fine sleeping in these old club world seats although bedding could be better. On time departure, smooth flight and early arrival at Heathrow. We went outside for a smoke and returned to the terminal through fast track. Security at LHR has always been terrible, but today security staff was too busy chatting among themselves so all bags went through without 'secundary' checks. We had a lovely shower at the 'spa', what a fabulous facility. The South Lounge was crazy busy and it is just a design disaster. Who ever choose the bizarre combination of furniture: what a mess! Food on offer was solid and so are the drinks. Our home stretch to Amsterdam was pretty straight forward. Lousy welcome at the door but crew recovered well and made everyone feel special with excellent bar-cart service. I love the 'double'-servings of drinks. English tea is about the worst meal concepts in the world and I really don't understand BA stuck to it through the years. No-one like the cucumber white bread things, but hey... On time landing in Amsterdam but the usual long taxi then clumsy jet bridge connection ended up with a 20 minute late arrival, why is it so hard to connect a jetbridge in Amsterdam? Flying club in BA is still wonderful. I Love it!"
96,"✅ Trip Verified |  Very poor service, very frustrating. Firstly my flight to LHR was cancelled on 16 Mar23, while I got a text message to inform me, the information desk was unable to confirm if was correct or scam. Once this was confirmed, I went to the counter to get my new boarding pass. At the counter they informed me that the coach will be leaving in 15mins for the hotel. We (me and other fellow travelers) waited for over 45mins, there was no one at the coach stand to guide us or answer any questions. The transfer hotel was 30 mins away from the airport. When we got to the hotel which is around 10:15pm the staff informed that dinner closes at 10:30. that was a rush. It appeared more of a Motel than an hotel. The room - was smelling of weed, being a non-smoker this was uncomfortable. Although I wanted to compromise and rest, when I went to wash my face, the tap on the sink came off in my hands, I panicked and asked the reception staff to change my room. After some discussion, they agreed to change it. I went to the alternate room, to my horror, it was occupied. I asked the staff to call a cab, and I left. "
97,"Not Verified |  Generally poor. Sent to gate on time, sat maybe 30 minutes, was then announced as crew were not familiar with the A321 there would be a delay. Clearly nonsense and there was a retraction on board of this statement. Watched the crew walk through to the gate, my impression was they did not want to be there. Was given a miniscule amount of water, small bag of pretzels and then it was announced there would be a wait for any further cabin service as card processing machines were u/s. No further updates or sight of crew for next two hours, then attempted to charge us for even a glass of water. When I said this should be complimentary, girl said it was not her problem and walked away."
98,"Not Verified |  BA changed our prepaid seats at the last minute and charged us to select new seats. Flight took off late, cabin crew served a tiny packet of pretzels. Arrived at Heathrow late, put on a remote stand, loaded onto buses to terminal. Held up at transit security by a clown of a member of staff, allowed 15 passengers at a time because of a trial. Queued at security for 20 minutes. "
99,Not Verified |  Flew from London Heathrow to Marrakech. BA changed our pre paid seats at the last minute and even charged us to select other seats. Boarding was chaos. Staff were rude demanding selected passengers put their hand luggage in the hold. I had one small bag however they never demanded other passengers with 2/3 bags and some with hand luggage that was obviously too big. Flight was late taking off and the snack was a miserable tiny packet of cheese pretzels. This airline is going downhill rapidly.
100,"Not Verified | I was meant to fly in January to Algeria. I paid over £300 for the ticket. Just a few days before I was meant to fly, my wife broke her foot. I had to then rebook it in March and pay another £100. I called British Airways 3 weeks before my flight in March and I told them again that it had to me rebooked, as my wife was still not well. They told me that I don’t have to pay anything to get it rebooked as I sent them a letter from the hospital saying my wife wasn’t well. However, they never sent me the ticket. They made me wait for nearly 4 weeks and they asked me to pay either £316 on top of the £450 that I paid previously. Or the second option they gave me is to get a refund of £80. (Tax only). I found it ridiculous that they told me to pay a fraction of the money I previously paid. Each time I call them, they hang up on me; or they continue telling me to pay £360. I made a complaint, and nothing happened."
101,"✅ Trip Verified |  We have flown repeatedly with British Airways and the One World alliance over the last few weeks. Every flight was delayed. Now we are back at the airport in Miami and have another massive delay so we will miss our connecting flight. Finally, our luggage arrived in Puerto Rico with a 3-day delay and we had to reschedule our round trip ... we haven't received any information about our luggage to this day, luckily we checked it ourselves at the airport and it was there. The last delayed flight meant the cabin crew that they too miss their connecting flights and we are on the same plane and they can't do anything.  Wir sind in den letzten Wochen immer wieder mit Britisch Airways und dem One World Zusammenschluss geflogen. Jeder Flug war verspätet. Nun sitzen wir wieder in Miami am Flughafen und haben schon wieder eine massive Verspätung sodass wir unseren Anschlussflug verpassen werden. Zuletzt ist auch unser Gepäck mit 3 Tagen Verspätung in Puerto Rico angekommen und wir mussten unseren Rundreise umplanen… wir haben bis heute noch keine Info über unser Gepäck erhalten, zum Glück haben wir selbst am Flughafen nachgesehen und es war da… Beim letzten verpspäteten Flug meinte die Kabinen Crew dass auch sie ihre Anschlussflüge verpassen und wir im selben Flugzeug sitzen und sie können nichts machen. "
102,"✅ Trip Verified |  I was horrified by the extremely small seats and the poor training that the crew clearly receives. Not one of them exuded any kind of warmth or expressed any desire to make our journey pleasant. The seats were so narrow that regardless of the size of your neighbors you are forced to touch each other constantly, if the seat in front of you is reclined you have no choice but to recline your own, or else you are breathing in the head/ scalp of the person in front of you. Food was revolting, they don't even provide napkins unless you ask with the pre-meal drinks and the secondary meal. The last time I flew BA it was a completely other experience and I was so sorry to see how far the quality level has slid. It was really majorly disappointing and I regret that I have already purchased 2 other intercontinental trips with the company. I will now have to see if I can change them. The pathetic 250 ml bottle of water, it's just a sip. On the shorter flights the seats couldn't even be reclined which was a great pity since the flight was delayed by almost 3 hours and we had to wait on board."
103,"✅ Trip Verified |  
The worst cabin experience ever: cramped seats, very low cost style and uncomfortable. Could suit for short flights but not for a 5 hours service. Catering is also a shame: 250ml of water + a chocolate bar for a 5 hours service. Will never fly BA again. "
104,"✅ Trip Verified | First time flying with British Airways and first time flying to the Americas from India via London Heathrow. I chose Premium Economy at a reasonable price. I was quite comfortable, however, the first leg of the flight from Mumbai to Heathrow, the plane was a bit outdated and there was only a foot rest. The second leg, from Heathrow to Nassau, the plane was brand new and my premium economy seat had a pop up leg support which was much more comfortable. Cabin service was fine - I appreciated that they didn't come through the cabin often while everyone was sleeping. The meals weren't that great to be honest. After landing in Heathrow, we had to wait on the tarmac for 45 minutes waiting for an open gate. My connection was less than an hour long! The BA staff in the Heathrow Airport helped me move through security quickly and I made it with time to spare for my next flight. When I arrived in Nassau, I found that my luggage didn't make it due to the short connection time in London. The BA baggage representative in Nassau was extremely professional and took down my claim. My luggage arrived on the next BA flight a few days later, and British Airways Nassau representative delivered it over to a charter airline which shipped it to the island I was staying on. Very impressive and efficient!"
105,✅ Trip Verified |  The latest affront. Stood in first class line for an hour. Finally go up front and the BA agent let 4 supposed VIPS with 12-14 large to-be-checked bags in front of all of us. Arrogant and unapologetic. Add this to a long list of post-Covid disappointments. We are done with BA.
106,"Not Verified |  Booked a flight return flight between London and Munich for 3/11 to 3/17 in December. The return flight was cancelled and re-booked from 3/17 to 3/12. British Airways only notified me of the first change, but not the second. Getting the flight reinstated took multiple phone calls on both occasions. Each time needing to find a helpful representative. British Airway employees told me that even though they cancelled my flight they did not have to refund the ticket. They tried to charge an $800 change fee. Through repeatedly calling back, British Airways reinstated my 3/17 flight on 2/20 and then again on 3/6. To make sure it did not get changed again, i checked the status of my ticket daily from 3/12 to 3/15. It was intact those days. On 3/16 when it was time to check-in for the flight, it was gone. At the airport the staff at the British Airways check-in counter are not BA employees, so cannot help resolve problems. There are no BA representative at the Munich Airport. The confirmation documentation from British Airways was of no value. I was left stranded at the airport."
107,"✅ Trip Verified |  I tried to check in on line and was informed that this was not possible. I was given no reason for this. I telephoned BA customer service and must have wasted nearly 2 hours being given wrong phone numbers and incorrect information. Staff need customer training, better knowledge of their product, and some manners. BA customer service was virtually non existent. I will never fly with them again."
108,"✅ Trip Verified |  A catalogue of failures. We flew from Belfast to Heathrow a week ago and the flight was delayed by over three and a half hours. We missed our onward Air Canada flight to Calgary as a result. On arriving in Calgary (after re-routing via Vancouver which added over 6 hours to our journey) we met other passengers who had also missed the same Air Canada flight as their British Airways flight from Manchester had also been delayed by several hours. We are now on our way home only to find our Heathrow to Belfast flight, which had already been cancelled and put back 2 hours, is now delayed by another 2 hours. Avoid British Airways like the plague."
109,"✅ Trip Verified |  
Our flight out to Dubrovnik was at the painful time of 6:30 in the morning and from London Gatwick, not an easy airport to get to at that hour especially as you have to be at the airport minimum 2hrs before to be ready to board. I understand why the likes of easyJet, Ryanair or Wizzair fly at very odd times to utilise cheaper slots at airports, but it seems an odd choice for BA given most people like us who fly with them choose them based on quality not on price alone. Outbound LGW-DBV: Boarding was fairly quick, easy and efficient and we took off on time. Pilot announcements clear, professional and inspired confidence which is something I appreciate and expect of BA pilots. Aircraft was clean and it had not been through the recent refurbishment program yet so had the advantage of having the 'Pinnacle' seats in economy still with more padding and adjustable winged headrests for better comfort. Complimentary Harrogate Mineral water given as usual which is a premium touch, complimentary snack of a Nutrigain bar was poor and not premium however. Cabin crew felt very unpolished in both presentation and behaviour - messy ill-fitting uniforms and unclassy make-up. Toilets clean and maintained, appreciate anti-bacterial wipes being kept available post-covid. Inbound DBV-LGW: For some reason no online or app check-in available, despite Dubrovnik Airport being a very modern airport with state of the art facilities. No queue at manual check-in though, and ground staff were very warm, friendly and helpful. Pro-actively offered to take our larger hand-luggage into hold free of charge, but we decided to keep with us as we would have to dash for train home from airport and trains on the other end were being cancelled already. We did not understand the delay to our flight as the inbound flight for that day had took off on time and landed on time. Also we travelled to Dubrovnik out of season, and the airport was empty at that hour, with all services being available solely for this flight taking off that evening. All the passengers in the terminal at that time including us were there to take this flight. We boarded on time and then we all sat at the gate for 15 minutes for no reason. It's truly bizarre how BA managed to take off late when all the services at the airport were operating and live solely for the purpose of enabling this flight to take off. Pilots for this flight were unpolished, with unclear announcements - during the flight one couldn't even remember where we flying back to! No apology for delay. Cabin crew a bit smarter presented and seemed more approachable. Harrogate water given out and the worlds tiniest bag of pretzels complimentary. Seats for this flight were horrendous and the new 'slimline' ones BA are installing from row 14 onwards. These seats have barely any padding, so very hard and also have no headrests so very hard to get comfortable. We landed 55 minutes late in Gatwick and again no apology was given - we were lucky to catch the last uncanceled train home otherwise we'd been stranded for hours. We'd spent half an hour circling Gatwick because we missed our original landing slot. Given 7 because in the context of the short-haul market thats what they deserve - we fly BA as we don't fly the low-cost carriers after so many bad experiences, but it's by no measure good, just the least bad option. Given 1 point extra solely for giving something complimentary onboard."
110,"Not Verified |  If I could give a minus rating, I would. Supposed to be LHR-AMS at 14.05 on 13th March. Get to LHR at 12.00, email to say flight cancelled. No one able to help at LHR, said to use the app. Only halfway sensible option was from LCY-AMS at 17.05, so taxi over there as trains from LHR not working (ok, not BA's fault). Get to LCY, showing as cancelled on screen, so check the app and there it is. Rebook again via the app to the 15.30 departure, go to desk to drop bag and was told that I was only on standby for the flight, with no guarantee of a seat, despite the app telling me it was confirmed. The 18.35 to AMS was already overbooked so was moved onto the 19.30 flight to Rotterdam. The 15.30 and 18.35 were both cancelled anyway, as it happened. Eventually took off and the best thing I can say is that it landed intact. Return from AMS-LHR, similar story. Arrive at AMS, screen shows the 21.00 is cancelled. Quickly check app, and confirmed it was. No emails, no texts, nothing. Rebooked via app to the 22.00 departure, so could have been worse. Desk agent helpfully printed me a boarding card as the app was unable to issue anything for a rebooked flight. Overall, dreadful. They just don't care and hide behind apps and automated call centres. Avoid unless you have no other option, and even then stop and consider if you 'really' need to go."
111,"✅ Trip Verified | Plane was over an hour late leaving, no problem that can happen. But on arrival at Heathrow, the plane sits on the runway for 45 minutes as there was no free stand to go to. Then once at the stand we waited another 45 minutes as there was no bridge available to enable us to get off the plane. Just pathetically inefficient."
112,"Not Verified |  We were flying World Traveller Plus their Premium service. What it was not was Premium. We have travelled with many airlines and lucky enough to fly Premium most times. BA's premium is the worst I have come across. The flight from Heathrow to JFK was just ok, the flight back was in a plane that should not be used. Old, dirty, uncomfortable with two broken seats out of the four we had, one would not recline and one reclined without using the button. BA needs to look at the Premium service and offer exactly that instead of trying to cut costs. They have fallen far behind their competitors, they were once my preferred airline but now I try and avoid at all costs. I would rather pay more and fly with someone else."
113,Not Verified |  This was literally one of the worst experiences. I haven’t been to an airport since. It began in Orlando flying back the flight plan system went down and we were stuck on the tarmac for 6 hours. Poor customer service and just ignored at times. Then missed my connecting flight and we were told not to leave the baggage area without our bags. Even though I booked through to Dublin. Another 4 hours I was told my bags were lost and to continue to the desk to book a flight. Another hour later I was handed a card with a number and told to ring it. I was cut off three times and told I wouldn’t be able to get home that day despite several flights being available. Just booked my own flight and had lost my suit and presents for Christmas and missed an engagement party.
114,"✅ Trip Verified |  The usual shambolic unfolding that BA has now unfortunately been come to known for. We had a long weekend flight booked to Munich that was supposed to be departing on 9th February at 19:55. This happened to be our first flight with our newborn (3 month old) daughter. It turned out to be a horror show of incompetence. Just under 3hrs before scheduled departure, the original 9th February flight was cancelled. We received an email as we were boarding the Heathrow express. I’d booked a day of holiday off work for this trip. We ended up getting doing a round trip to Paddington instead. On the way back from the cancelled flight, both me and my wife tried calling BA. Despite one of us having silver membership (possibly the largest joke of a membership currently out there), I took us nearly 45 minutes to speak to someone who could help. I believe BA outsource their call centres and so you end up talking to people who are following a script. The result is that you might as well be speaking to an AI rather than a human. We often received the response similar to ‘computer says no’. If this is the service level for silver members I can’t imagine what a regular punter has to put up with. When the phone originally connected to a person, I had to wait 5 minutes as his computer booted up. - BA then proceeded to auto-book us onto a new flight for the next day but going to a different destination. Our original flight was to Munich and the auto-booked replacement flight was to Salzburg. When asking the robot at the BA call centre why they booked us on a replacement flight to a location 135km apart, they couldn’t understand my frustration.  Eventually, someone was able to book us onto a flight the following day at 17:00. Not ideal as I’d wasted a valuable day off work and the hotel wouldn’t refund us or move our booking, but at least we were going to Munich and not Salzburg. - The day of the new flight came round and, this time, we managed to get all the way to the check in desk. Upon arriving at the check in desk, we were told that our rebooked flight had just been cancelled 4 minutes earlier. No email. No text. No notification ever arrived from BA to tell us that the flight had been cancelled. Incomprehensible as to how this could have possibly happened. The check in person said I should get on the app to rebook. At this point, I didn’t know whether to explode with anger or cry. Luckily, another check in person had an ounce of sympathy and explained to the useless check in person that he could actually rebook us. We were booked onto another flight later that evening (19:55 - BA0958). Unfortunately, that meant 5hrs in the grotty lounge with a 3 month old baby. It appears that everyone now has access to a lounge and so there’s really no difference between the lounge and a hostel, other than you get free stuff in the former. This was not a pleasant experience. We did eventually arrive in Munich and, despite asking, didn’t get our push chair/stroller delivered to the front of the plane. The plane was a characteristically BA dumping ground - they used to give you sanitising wipes so you could clean your seat and tray table down but they seemed to have cut back on this service too. All in all, another shocking BA service. A lost day of holiday and not an an ounce of empathy/sympathy/understanding at all from any of the employees I interacted with."
115,Not Verified |  Lost my case and took 6 weeks to locate it and still have not replied to me after 8 weeks. I had a business class flight scheduled on Dec 12 2022 … Manchester > Copenhagen -Bangkok and return flight Dec 27 2022 … Bangkok > Stockholm > Manchester. SAS Airlines left Manchester over an hour late due to the weather and air traffic control. When I arrived in Copenhagen to get the connecting flight for Bangkok we were 10 minutes too late and the flight had gone (half of the plane missed it).. SAS Airlines provided me with a new itinerary the same day being … Copenhagen (SAS) > London (BA) > Dubai (Emirates) > Bangkok. I returned from Copenhagen to London and the collected my boarding pass at BA. We were over 2 hours late leaving London due the weather and a passenger being asked to leave the flight. We arrived in Dubai late and was informed the flight had gone. Emirates then informed me that I had to speak with Thai Air to get another flight issued. I spent over an hour phoning Thai Air with nobody picking up the phone. I then spoke with Thai Air Dubai who informed me that they did not have any alternative flights and suggested that I buy a new ticket and then claim the funds back later. I paid £1279.43 for a Kuwait Airways flight out of Dubai > Kuwaiti > Bangkok. Whilst in Dubai I checked with Kuwait Airlines regards my baggage and they informed me that it had not arrived from London and they would locate it and forward to my Bangkok address the following day. My baggage never arrived despite me completing lost baggage forms. I arrived back home yesterday and was informed by BA that they have found my bag in London. 
116,"✅ Trip Verified |  The incoming and outgoing flight was delayed because French Air Traffic Controllers were on strike so we were routed over Germany, and not BA's fault. O arrival the pilot announced we could not pull onto the stand as no ground crew had showed up to turn on the automatic last metre guidance. It took around 40 minutes to find someone. Then when that was done there was a further delay as there were no ground staff to operate the skybridge. All told we were trapped on the plane for over an hour within metres of our gate. Total disruption, wasted time. Absolutely no excuse for this."
117,"✅ Trip Verified |  Back in December my family and I as we were getting onto the plane were refused. Even though we had boarding passes and seats allocated and had booked 6 months in advance we were refused. It turns out that someone had not turned up to work and they couldn't let all the passengers on the plane. So quite randomly (not) 9 people were selected and turned away. We were selected as we had no check in luggage and it was easier to boot us off despite them not knowing my circumstances, if I had connecting flights in London etc. I sought compensation from BA (which I was told I could do) and what an absolute nightmare this process has been. They wouldn't acknowledge my complaint for my family until I had an authorisation letter from them saying I could act on their behalf. Even though, I booked and paid for the tickets. So, I uploaded the authorisation letter no less than 10 times. Every time they told me they received it and every time I followed it up they told me they hadn't. There was no other way except to post from Australia to the UK to some office. Eventually, it finally go through to them. I have now chased up the reimbursement four times. Each time they tell me it has been sent and to be patient. Today they tell me that they need to check my account details. So, again, I send them the same information that I have done before. AND I wait patiently for my reimbursement. I am convinced that their business model is for you to get so frustrated you just go away. Well, you know what I won't."
118,"✅ Trip Verified |  As usual the flight is delayed this week, it already 3 hours and I’m held on a bus waiting to get taken to the plane. I really can’t explain how much I detest British Airways. If it was a cheap budget airline I could accept it, but it’s premium prices for the most unreliable service."
119,"✅ Trip Verified | A short BA euro trip and this is where BA excel. Clean aircraft, good crew, professional, on time (within LHR standards) and a good value product delivered. Pity the in flight food sales were not a bit more exciting and appealing as more than a few asked about the non existent hot food options. But good overall. Check in self service is great now once you know how to use it with plenty assistance on hand for those who can’t."
120,"Not Verified |  We are flying Business class for most of our flight and then Premium economy for the balance. In addition to the plane tickets we paid an additional $225/pp for our seats. Now BA is changing planes, they arbitrarily put us in separate seating areas (my wife & I) when we were sitting together before and they want to charge one of us additional $$ to be re-seated next to each other.  They moved our seats away from each other and we shouldn't have to pay for their change of planes and their decision to not have us sitting together! We haven't even flown yet, this airline is horrible."
121,"✅ Trip Verified |  I am in Australia and on Friday night, went online to book a flight from Heathrow to Malpensa (Milan). I did not realise that when I specifically searched for flights to Malpensa it offered options to other airports in Milan. When I received my itinerary by email, it was to another airport in Milan. The itinerary email did not provide any means of contact for changes or advise me of the 24 hour cooling off period. As it was the weekend here I was unable to reach their office until Monday when they advised me there was no refund (other than fees) as I had missed the 24 hour cooling off period. Apparently as the ticket was issued in the UK, I needed to contact them. I have now cancelled the ticket and I will be going out of my way in the future to avoid flying British Airways."
122,"✅ Trip Verified |  At 7.54 am on the day of travel whilst driving to London Heathrow I received an email advising my flight had been cancelled. I was offered an alternative flight with American Airlines which I had no alternative but to accept as I must travel today. I was flying to LA to see a family member who is end of life. The American Airlines desk downgrade my cabin from premium economy to economy. Tried 3 times BA provide telephone number, total useless, no help, given me wrong email address for sending my complains given to me in the email. I have been a BA frequent flyer for decades and have been a loyal customer. I now find I am travelling 11 hours in Economy without even the possibility of a refund let alone an upgrade. This is completely unacceptable. What has happened to this company? I have had better treatment from Ryanair."
123,"✅ Trip Verified |  Would happily fly them again. I had a personal emergency and was allowed to reschedule my flights free of charge. Onboard service on LHR-IST was no frills, but JFK-LHR was impeccable: good food, lots of movies/cds on the IFE, open bar service the entire flight. Friendly flight attendants always happy to provide an extra drink/snack."
124,"Not Verified |  Flew premium, only worth the extra money for the bit of extra room. Penny pinching means there’s no other benefit - one drink service on 10 hour flight, no fizz offered before take off, poor food, boarding was badly organised. Food left on tables 30 min before landing with no tea and coffee offered. Few small cups of water passed around but nothing “premium” about this. New planes have been decorated terribly - feels like you’re in a dentist waiting room. Devoid of any personality or joy. Only fly if the only option, only fly premium if it’s not too expensive - seriously not worth much more than economy these days, especially if you’re in the middle 4."
125,"✅ Trip Verified |  First our morning flight was cancelled and moved to an afternoon flight, understanding sometimes these situations are unavoidable, however it lost us one day's experience in Cairo. We were quite upset when we got onto the plane and were squashed into regular seats, on both flights. As my husband had spasms, he had to stretch his legs across my lap, and not once did ANY of the attendants ask if we were okay as we were clearly struggling. As the service came to us for food, each choice we made we were told, they were all out and we had to settle for what they had left. I did the correct thing once home and sent in my complaints. They responded with a $100 pound voucher for our group."
126,"✅ Trip Verified |  Although it was a bit uncomfortable flight in an economy, the flight attendants made the flight the best possibly could.  Such a nice and professional crew. Very attentive and looking out for their customers."
127,"✅ Trip Verified |  Boarding was decently organised. The A380 still has the rather strange configuration in Club World where you neighbour is sitting in the opposite position. The A380 was nearly full, rather poor amenity bag. The welcome drink was ok but then rather long waiting for the aperitive what is made in the pantry. The meal was ok but not great, aside the Champagne no European wines on this flight. Service was friendly but rather slow, no spontaneous refills of drinks offered. Acceptable continental style breakfast. Extremely narrow restrooms without any lotions or similar. It was an acceptable experience, nothing more. After landing 50 minutes waiting for luggage labelled as priority."
128,"✅ Trip Verified | Boarding on time and departure on time for a flight to London Heathrow that is very ok, the A320 with rather narrow seats. In business light meal a Caesars salad, a mousse as sweet and choice of drinks - nothing wrong for such a short flight. FA's were very friendly and landing on time."
129,"✅ Trip Verified |  My original flight was cancelled just over 2 weeks before my actual flight and although alternative flights were available, British airways affected the trip I planned. It feels like BA is doing a favour to passengers rather than being paid to deliver the service."
130,✅ Trip Verified |  Delayed just for a change. Poor communication. British Airways sells premium prices flight tickets and delivers no better than a low cost airline. Customer service is impossible to contact and it seems BA tries hard to hide any possible email communication address when it's available.
131,"✅ Trip Verified |  Very competent check in staff, saw had a problem with my left arm and insisted I could not take exit seat. Moved me to row 30 where the middle seat was empty. On the other hand on board - huge line for toilets - 45 min into a 2.30 min flight a crew member realised one of the toilets is closed - as crew had put their luggage there. They announced that they could not serve hot drinks on this flight and to bear with them as service will be slow. On asking why: ""They did not give us enough cups for hot drinks. And the card machine is not working so we have to fill out each credit card slip"". A bottle of water and a nutrigrain bar. "
132,"✅ Trip Verified |  Check in was so slow, no self check in and bag drop. Boarding was ok, flight totally full. Booked row 9 which was ok. Some space in overhead bins. Seat and legroom ok. Cabin crew ok, smiled, gave out the bottle of water and pretzels. Flight itself was ok, landed 25 mins early and then waited 30 minutes for a stand and ground crew. Bags came off reasonably quickly. BA still seems to believe it is something special, a premium carrier. The reality is that it is not. The only reason we flew BA was we got virtually free tickets because both flights were cancelled last year. BA is our carrier of last choice."
133,"✅ Trip Verified |  My review relates to the appalling experiences I had with British Airways on 14th February 2023. I was due to travel to Madrid with British Airways and before setting off I heard on the radio that there were flight delays. I looked at the Heathrow Airport website and saw that my flight had been cancelled. As a result of the information on the website, I called British Airways and have 26 minutes on hold I found myself speaking to somebody in a call centre in South Africa. The person was hard to understand due to a heavy accent and he was incompetent and insisted that the flight was not cancelled. I made my way to Heathrow and sure enough the flight was indeed cancelled. The woman in question had the audacity to declare that the flight was cancelled and that “there are no facilities here at the airport to rebook you”. She refused to let me and about 12 other people join the queue for the clearly marked assistance desk. The same woman and one of her colleagues gave out a card with a telephone number and told one rather elderly gentleman to “go online to rebook your seat”. I am visually impaired and found the attitude of the BA employee to be appalling. I called the number on the card the employee gave me and was again in a long queue to a call centre. The person who picked up the phone kept me waiting 22 minutes and declared that the flight was not cancelled and that the airport “must be wrong”. He then in a flippant tone said he was just informed that the flight was indeed cancelled and that I would have to go and speak to IBERIA customer services in Heathrow to rebook! I took the elderly gentleman with me to IBERIA where the counter staff member rolled her eyes in disgust and said that it was nothing to do with IBERIA. I returned to BA and this time I joined the check-in line and told a check-in agent what had happened. The man in question booked me onto the next available flight within a matter of a few minutes. He gave me a £30 voucher as a form of compensation but said he could not add my frequent flyer number with a partner airline. The voucher proved useless I am afraid as various shops in the predepature area refused to accept it and although I was told I could use it after clearing security none of the shops would accept it. Once aboard my new flight the service was minimal. Other than a tiny bottle of water and a packet of pretzels nothing else was available. This was a full flight as so many people had been transferred from the cancelled flight. BA Cabin crew announced that any additional items other than the small bottle of water and pretzels had to be ordered via their skyshop."
134,"✅ Trip Verified | This was my first time flying with BA & I was pleasantly surprised. Islamabad via Doha was very comfortable and the crew were great, friendly and helpful. The second flight was operated by Qatar Airways this was from Doha to Islamabad. My return journey was a direct BA flight, 46kg luggage allowance was really generous and stopped the hassle with connecting flights. Crew on this flight were really nice too. What let BA down was the food, it really was not nice, the IFE could do with some more content but that's not really a huge issue."
135,"✅ Trip Verified |  Lots of cancellations and delays and no one apologized. Edinburgh to London on Feb 14th, 2023, our original flight was cancelled, and the rebooked one was cancelled as well, the third rebooked one was supposed to departure at 12:50 and had several delays until 2:24. Then we had to wait 57 minutes for our luggage to arrive."
136,"✅ Trip Verified | BA 242 on the 6/2/23. Boarding was delayed due to late arrival from the incoming flight. Communication from the ground staff was excellent and keep us informed. In flight services were excellent, the crews were friendly with excellent service! Overall, very happy with BA."
137,"✅ Trip Verified |  Not only my first flight in 17 years, but also my first time back to England for 17 years. I flew from PMI-LGW on 21/01/2023 and returned on 29/01/2023. Both Wizz Air and EasyJet offered very inconvenient flight times and charged more than the flights were worth for baggage. British Airways were the most convenient and best value option available, they offered ideal flight times and the €18 charge per flight for baggage was very reasonable - Total cost for both flights was €126 +/- Regular update information via email, seamless online seat allocation and check in. Efficient staff at the check in desks at PMI and LGW ensured that long queues were dealt with as quickly as humanly possible. Immaculate aircraft, comfortable leather seats with adequate legroom (I'm 6'4"" tall) Cabin crew were polite, friendly and professional. In flight food and drinks were good quality and reasonably priced, I enjoyed the Meat Ploughman's and IPA beer (€10 -/+ total) on both flights I have flown 80+ times in the last 50 years with different airlines on various propeller and jet aircraft as well as one LGW-LHR helicopter transfer. Flying was a totally different experience 'back in the day', we are now in the age of the 'budget airline' Nostalgia aside.. British Airways are the best airline I've flown with."
138,"✅ Trip Verified |  My husband and myself were flying to Madrid on the 3rd of February for a Legal matter and we had to be in Madrid by 13:00 pm. We had booked our flight and car with BA Holidays. Unfortunately we chose a parking we had never used before, we got lost, and missed our 6:00 am flight to Madrid. I tried to stay calm, cold head and we went to British Airways to get help. The first lady that we spoke to asked if we had done the booking with BA Holidays, we didn't know that, she gave us a number to call and told us that she couldn't do anything else, that we had to call that number. We called the number, which was asking us to call another  number, which we did and there the message was that opening hours were from 8 am till 4 pm, We went back to the lady and explained that we couldn't wait until 8 am, but she told us that she could not do anything. I did reach out to another staff , a lovely young lady called Althea. She started to look at it, made several calls, went to check with someone else to an office, she managed to get someone to send me a text message that I had to call, and that got answered and the other lovely lady on the line, modified our booking to place us in the following flight at 7.30 am. They didn't charge us for that, our car reservation and flight back were maintained and we made it to Madrid. Without the support of the lovely Althea, her professionalism, her care for us, we would not have make it. She was so sweet, so caring, but at the same time so determined to help, she for sure went above and beyond her role and her responsibilities."
139,✅ Trip Verified | Organised boarding process. Really friendly crew. Quick drink and a snack. All in all a great experience. The crew are a credit to BA. The best crew in Europe.
140,"✅ Trip Verified |  Outward journey BA245 London to Buenos Aires Club World 10 January 2023. Our experience was poor from beginning to end. Although we had reserved seats 11F and 12J, another passenger was occupying 11F and crew made no attempt to address the problem. Eventually, I persuaded the passenger to move and occupy her designated seat 11D. We boarded punctually but were not offered drinks. When I asked for a drink, the crew member said it was too late and blamed the seating problem. The same crew member then began taking orders for dinner but did not write them all down and gave up after a few minutes for the safety briefing. She asked us to repeat our orders later. The hot flannels smelled musty and felt old and ragged.  One of the crew wondered aloud whether my companion and I were related.  My soup was cold, I was told it was served from flasks. Was that an explanation or an excuse? My coffee was weak and tasted like instant granules. My companion was initially served no bread roll with dinner. The breakfast menu stated a 'selection of rolls/pastries' but there was no choice and my companion was given a dried fruit pastry, where he would have chosen a bread roll.  Although we had not previously asked for or been offered any other than those supplied at the seat, small bottles of water ran out. Return journey BA244 Buenos Aires to London Heathrow World Traveller Plus 26 January 2023 was a huge contrast, from the warm welcome on boarding to crew’s professionalism throughout. It’s a poor reflection on Club World service that our experience in World Traveller Plus was so much better and kinder. Weighed against the advantages of a flat bed, the considerable price difference was not worth paying for the catalogue of errors and inconveniences outlined above."
141,"✅ Trip Verified | Check in agent at LHR was very helpful and friendly as were the in flight crew. Seat was comfortable with good leg room. However, the food was poor - barely better than economy class with a poor quality and limited selection of wine. In flight entertainment selections we’re very limited. Far inferior to what BA used to offer. Overall, this premium economy product was disappointing and very poor value for money."
142,"✅ Trip Verified |  Very disappointing. I book BA so I can fly during the day. My return flight at 6pm on 28/1/23 was cancelled, replaced by a flight at 9pm. It took off 1/2 hour late meaning I arrived at Gatwick well after midnight with no onward transport connections. I had to pay £70 for a taxi home. Plus the seats are really snug. I’m only 5’7” but my knees were hitting the seat in front. No more BA for me. They are trading on their name but the customer service and reliability has deteriorated. Ryanair has better aircraft and take-off slots."
143,"✅ Trip Verified | Excellent service both on the ground and on board - while their first class product might not be leading edge, the service around the entire experience was well worth the cost of the ticket. The Concorde room at Heathrow is well managed and a great place to relax prior to the trip. Flight was slightly delayed out of Heathrow but arrived on schedule in Johannesburg."
144,✅ Trip Verified |  Good lounge at Cape Town. On time departure. Drinks high quality. Sound dinner service. Breakfast reasonable. Arrival lounge was good but showers cold.
145,"✅ Trip Verified |  A really excellent journey. Lounge not overcrowded in late afternoon, plenty of edible food. Easy boarding. New Club World Suites great and compared to when we last travelled in them a year ago food and drink back to previous standards- choice of individual wines rather than bland blends, courses served individually with cut glass and china. Beef cheek really tasty as was a surprisingly good soup. Crew excellent. Good choice of movies. Breakfast after a good night's sleep- fruits etc first, couldn't manage the full English which was offered. Arrival on time. What more could you want? Not quite up to Gulf standards overall, but BA seems to have eventually got its business class back to standard"
146,"✅ Trip Verified |  This flight was one of the worst I have ever had in my life. I wanted to pamper myself, so I bought business class. I was looking forward to my new experience. I will not mention the chaos of changing gates several times, as these things may happen. What surprised me was the lack of attention to passengers. The flight was delayed by almost 3 hours. Even though staff offered vouchers, we had no idea where to get them, and we were told that we only had about 10 minutes to use them because boarding had already begun. Firstly, I did not see anyone with the voucher, and secondly, even if we got it, we were not able to use it. When I finally got to the airport, there was another waiting for about 30 minutes after cross check. Meantime, we were told that due to problems, they did not load any food, so the flight will be without any food on board. The only food offered and given to everyone on the plane was a small bag of nuts. As a business class passenger, I was offered drinks only. All in all, my business class contained 3 small glasses of juice.   I received no apology or compensation from the company at all. It was a disgraceful and cheap service for a very expensive price. "
147,"Not Verified | It seems that there is a race to the bottom amongst airlines. I cannot even check in because BA requires the submission of documents for Covid restrictions. However the form to start the submission process is hopelessly broken. After clicking ""submit"" the form just hangs forever. No error message is given. I tried three different browsers on three different devices. All have the same hang. Which means you cannot check in online nor can you select a seat. I tried using the chat bot, but after 30 minutes of clicking ""try again"" I thought I had donated enough time to BA. "
148,"Not Verified |  As a Spanish born individual living in England, I have been using British Airways for over 3 decades, multiple times a year. On 12th January 2023 I booked a flight for my son and I to go to Alicante. However, I was informed on the 17th January 2023 by my doctors that I am unable to fly due to an elbow operation I have had. As a result I decided to give my ticket to my daughter, calling up the Customer Service team for British Airways to make the change. On the 18th January 2023 they took my enquiry call. There seemed to be some speech delay in the call, which presented a small bit of difficulty, however I also struggled to understand the support staff member on top of this delay. When requesting to change the name on one of the tickets to my daughters name I was told this is not within the policy, and that I would need to cancel the ticket and rebook it. I was encouraged to divide the booking so myself and my son were on two different booking reference numbers. I accepted this and was then asked if I would like to cancel the booking. I insisted I would need to know the total of the refund. It’s lucky I did ask to check this, as I was then informed it would be roughly £9.00. The total cost of my booking was £394.64, which comes to £197.32 per passenger, leaving my refund total at less than 3% of the value of my purchase. This is despite the seat not be abandoned. According to BA  policy, all I am entitled to out of a simple change of name is less than 3% refund even when I’m buying the ticket right back then and there on the phone (probably for more money than it was worth a week ago)."
149,"✅ Trip Verified |  A rather empty and quiet flight to Tel Aviv, very friendly cabin crew and due to the emptiness of the flight I had an entire row to myself which allowed me to work easily and have as much space as required. Unfortunately upon landing the breaks overheated and we had to wait for the fire crew to cool them down which delayed us. Otherwise an overall excellent flight on BA's part. This was the first time I have flown this flight and it has actually taken off at the correct time."
150,✅ Trip Verified |  Easy check in and staff member was polite and helpful and made a specific point of acknowledging our loyalty to BA. Security at London was fast. Galleries North was fine and showers were good. Organised flight boarding. Plane was fine with good crew and new club world product. My wife had a damaged storage area but otherwise ok. After take off there was a good drinks and food service which was well run. Slept well on time arrival. We both found the new seat design harder to sleep in.
151,"✅ Trip Verified |  Being a silver flyer and booking a flight through BA to Dublin you would have thought I could use the lounge even though BA used Air Lingus for the flight. Travelled recently there with the same situation and was allowed in by a kind Gentleman at the desk even though he said I had to be Gold ? He was really accommodating and it wasn’t a big deal. But the two ladies on the desk were like no. No empathy there at all-saying the other guy shouldn’t have let me and they will have a word with him ? Come on BA I booked the flight through you, and you made me fly with Air Lingus so you should let me use the lounge as a silver flier. "
152,"Not Verified |  I find BA incredibly tacky and constantly looking for ways to get money out of customers. I have travelled using major airlines my whole life and although I know it sounds silly - when on a 4 hour flight on a major airline you do expect some form of beverage or snack as a curtesy and a port to charge your phone and not have to pay insane prices for luggage. There was no inflight entertainment and the aircraft was very snug, when I challenged why I had to pay for my own drink and why no inflight entertainment - I was told it was a short haul fight. My sisters met me from Cairo (which is an hour and half flight) and flew Egyptair and somehow received luggage allowance, drinks, food and inflight entertainment as well as a USB port to charge their phones. BA I now realise stands for Budget Airline. Staff were great - what you got for your money not so much."
153,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew ATL to LHR 8th Jan 2023. Was unlucky enough to be on board a 23 year old 777. Refit gave it a decent IFE screen and the seat looked decent. Although combine the IFE with the cheap and nasty earbuds, and any movie can be ruined. Headrest was great, just a pity little padding is used on the seat as my Wife and I were very uncomfortable. The leg room in general is poor, especially when passengers keep their seat reclined from start to finish. Zero room. Aircraft was tired. Rubber spacers falling out, silicone sealer falling apart in the toilets. Toilet seats old, stained. Rubber on arm rest was hanging off. No post take off drinks/snacks offered.  Meal was sent out after a couple of hours. Was poor. Chicken cubes that reminded me of dog food, mashed potatoes that were purified within an inch of their life. Stale rock hard roll, salad which was rice and carrots?! Dried crackers with no cheese. Kids meal was just as sad. Tiny leaf salad with enough dressing to refloat a shipwreck. Coffee creamer was given with the kids meal? Snack was decent for the adults, bagel with cheese and egg. Hot and tasty. Kids snack was a green wrap with spinach and onions in it.  Very very poor. Mix the food, BA service with a grunt, being crammed into a seat for 7 hours, landing at a remote stand and enduring a bus to the terminal and BA in my opinion, is terrible. This flight was so disappointing. Other than one great member of cabin crew, everything else was just average."
154,"Not Verified |  Great thing about British Airways A380 is the economy section upstairs. Get this if you can as it allows you to have small stowage cupboards at the window seats. Despite being not very old, the A380 looked tired inside. Broken side stowage, a seat that reclined uncontrollably and slow to react IFE. The food was supposed to be Christmas dinner. 3 wafer thin bits of dry turkey, 4 over cooked sprouts and some cubed potatoes. Poor in taste and quality. Mousse desert was great though. Slight issue during the snack meal. Ordered a childs option which was marked as such. Regular meal arrived as well and they were exactly the same. Asked a crew member to be told the difference was the sticker on the box. Staff were ok. Couple decent but mostly just ok. Overall, BA just seems a tad cheap these days. Great to sit upstairs but that was where the enjoyment ended. Just seemed a bit dull and like BA are just an average airline.
"
155,"Not Verified | The staff are friendly. The plane was cold, we were shivering, they gave light blankets but they were not enough. Meals were basic. Entertainment was basic. Luggage is delayed, today is day 6 and BA staff over the phone say ""call after 72 hours"". Tracking system is very vague, had to extract information from staff that they arrived to Vancouver on Jan 2nd. I offered to collect baggage but very vague answer ""call the Airport"", asked her for BA phone number at YVR but she said ""we don't have a phone number for you to call, call the main Airport"". Their policy states you can make a claim only after 21 days."
156,"✅ Trip Verified | Probably the worst business class experience I've ever had on an airline. Just a few of the issues: Required to purchase seats on international (Club World) business class. This was not made known during the ticket purchase process and cost me an additional $600 on a single leg (LHR-LAX) for a family of four. Given the very strange business class seating layout on BA A380s, leaving the seat selection to change could have been disastrous for my family. Ridiculously long boarding times on even small aircraft. On my VIE-LHR leg, the boarding time for the A320 was over 50 minutes long, leading to a delayed departure. There was no urgency on the part of staff to speed up the boarding times. Severe overcrowding in the boarding area in satellite C of terminal 5 at Heathrow. Boarding staff would not allow passengers to enter the roped off queue area before boarding (I have no idea why not) and so crowding was extreme. The overall boarding area was far too small for an A380, and I believe this satellite was designed and built after the first A380s were delivered. Online check-in in advance of flights appears to be completely broken. I was urged repeatedly (on the BA website, and via email and text) to ""upload my COVID documents"" even though, at the end of 2022, there are no COVID documents required for travel. After I filled in basic contact information on the website - and did not upload any ""COVID documentation"" - I was informed (several hours later) that my ""COVID documents have been verified"". I then received another text message urging me to ""upload my COVID documentation"". On the VIE-LHR leg, the shop.ba.com page that one is directed to after attempting to connect to wifi on the plane indicated ridiculously incorrect remaining flight times - over six hours, and then four hours just before landing. BA lounges for Club Europe and Club World at Heathrow are often seriously overcrowded. Furniture and carpeting and other finishes in the clubs are worn or dirty. That said, the food in the lounges was of pretty good quality. The food quality in BA lounges at Heathrow may be the only redeeming thing about this airline. Onboard, food and beverage service was far below average for international business class. Terrible, one might say. On the LHR-LAX leg, there was no pre-meal beverage service and there were NO mid-flight beverage services at all. Unlike most business class offerings on other airlines, there was no taking a meal order by flight attendants at the beginning of the flight. Meals were brought out haphazardly shortly after take off, with the ""chicken or fish?"" type of meal selection similar to economy class. There was no coffee or tea service after meals. Food quality was poor, with the pre-landing snack of a ""ploughman's lunch"" being downright disgusting. . There was no beverage or bar set-up in the galley areas - beverages available to passengers during the flight - as is standard on most international business class offerings. Even bottles of water seemed be hidden away, requiring one to ask the flight attendants for water. I won't comment on the bizarre seating layout on the A380, as others have rightly panned the awkwardness and extremely poor design of the seating. The seats are not 6' 2"" long as stated on the BA website, and I found the seats too short for my 6' 2"" height. The ""Priority"" luggage tags were not followed in the baggage delivery."
157,"✅ Trip Verified | Definitely not recommended, especially for business class. The seats are ridiculous and small, the food is mediocre if that, and good luck with the internet even if you pay for full internet for the entire flight. The service however has been great. My attendant saved me from crying. I don’t know who designed this aircraft but in this expensive business class, in order to move out of you middle seat to go to the bathroom you must rudely climb over the person’s legs sitting in the aisle seat. Your seat is like an enclosed tiny cubicle with no storage space. I’ve unfortunately traveled British Airways business class at least 4 times within the last 4 months. Never again unless there is no other choice. By the way, the business class lounge south at Heathrow is a cattle pen."
158,"✅ Trip Verified |  BA shuttle service across the UK is still surprisingly a good product. When compared with BA long haul that doesn’t always get the best of comments at times. It’s reasonable priced, works well, fresh crews and no queues or long distances to walk. I don’t know why they still offer a COVID style bottle of water and snack when just stretching to a cup of tea and snack would be great add on for this service. Currently they have an on line sky cafe but it’s too fiddly to work or get connected in short trips."
159,"✅ Trip Verified | I must admit like many others I tend to avoid BA long haul where possible due to the many poor reviews. But had my first ride on a BA A380 the other day so it was an exception. What can I say. Aircraft immaculate and economy seat really comfortable but that’s about it. IFE didn’t work but wasn’t that interesting anyway. I got the map screenshot for a while. Lunch was poor quality but plenty of nice white wine and other alcoholic drinks made up for it. Cabin crew pleasant but poor grooming lets them down. Some skirts, some trouser suits, some long sleeves some short. Some jackets some waistcoat. Some cardigans on at time and all in all they could have done better I think. Baggage delivery was really quick. Summing up well I am still not coming back to BA not yet. Maybe the old charm will return soon."
160,"Not Verified |  When will BA update their Business class cabin - 8 across on a 777. It is not so much travelling facing backwards as it were, but the cabin staff having to pass food trays across the front of passengers paying business class fares! As for having to pay to reserve a specific seat - an antiquated idea. The cabin staff were fine, food acceptable, check-in OK and Business lounge (breakfast) acceptable. The lack of space in the seating area, small screen and disfunctional entertainment equipment disappointing. Having to step over the reclining passengers feet is not attractive. "
161,✅ Trip Verified |  Paid £200 day before flight for an upgrade from economy to premium economy. At checkin they could not find my booking so a little wait while they rang someone who explains on the upgrade you get deleted from the system the checkin agent sees? Took about 5 minutes to resolve. Seat was nice enough. Stowage pocket in front a bit small. Food was reasonably nice. Shame that the bathroom is all the way back through economy and there is a bit of a queue. IFE system is good but selection mediocre. Worst part of the flight is that at CPT so we were on a remote stand and bussed in. Through passport control quickly but then it took an absolute age to get our luggage which ruined what would otherwise have been a reasonable flight. Upgrade was worth it at £200 maybe £300 (its a long flight) but their offers of £2000 or whatever for premium economy is comedy pricing. Score before the luggage fiasco would have been 7 or 8 / 10. With the luggage fiasco I can't rate it more than 4/10.
162,"✅ Trip Verified |  BA website did not work (weirdly deleted my flight from ""upcoming flights"" on the day of departure). Chaos at Cape Town airport with hundreds queuing as the computers were down. Chaos at the gate / no queue management for premium passengers. Very nice new A350 with smart new club suite. Champagne warm (cabin crew said its impossible to serve it cold, which is not true as Air France manage it). Disappointing meal, wine served so late after the food you have finished by the time it arrives. Cheese ice cold and tasteless (why can't the champagne / white wine be in the fridge used for the cheese?). Good IFE system but mediocre film selection. Disappointing breakfast. Overall: 3 / 10. Flew Air France business the month before which was way better. So sad what's become of BA."
163,"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely terrible experience with British Airways. After a short flight from London Heathrow to Frankfurt, they couldn't get my suitcase to me in time for my next flight (on Cathay Pacific) to Melbourne, despite a 3 hour gap between the two flights. Told me they would arrange for the suitcase to be transferred directly to Melbourne - instead, it got to Hong Kong and left there. When they finally tracked it down, they sent it back to London. All happened over Christmas, so very stressful yet minimal communication from their team. While the plane crew may be lovely, the service outside of this has been nothing short of dreadful, and if given the option, I will avoid flying with them in future."
164,"✅ Trip Verified |  Vancouver to Delhi via London. We were booked to fly from Vancouver to New Delhi via London Heathrow on Dec 22nd. We received an email on Dec 20th informing us about the industrial action in the UK. I called to find out how it may impact our travel. The representative kind of scared us of being possibly stranded during our travel and offered us a full refund. We called again to confirm about other options but he did not offer any other solutions. We asked to cancel our tickets and he told us about the cancellation fee. We booked new tickets with another airline with double the cost as our trip was urgent (simultaneously). He told us he no longer can cancel our tickets on the system but promised us he will make it happen because he told us we would get a full refund. He processed the cancellation. 5 hours later he emailed us that the tickets couldn’t be cancelled and suggested we cancel our new tickets once he found out they were with another airline (we lost $1000 from cancelling the new tickets). Now, the representative claimed that he never said there won’t be any services available and asked us why we were worrying about the industrial action, and that other “arrangements” will be made if there were any issues (this was new information never given to us before). We kept our British Airway tickets. The next day, we asked to speak with the manager and report that we were misguided about the whole situation. We never heard back from the manager. As we logged in to check-in 15 hours before take off, we found that our VAN — LHR flight was cancelled (due to the bad weather in Vancouver). We did not receive any emails from the airport nor the airline about this change. We called BA again and asked about rearrangements for our flight, to which they offered rebooking with an additional $700-1000 per person price difference and the dates offered were about 7 days after our original flight was supposed to leave. Additionally, to cancel the rest of the flights with them which we could not reach since our first flight was cancelled, we had to pay about $1000 cancellation fee to get a refund. We were very frustrated with the overall experience and no accommodations nor accountability as they wanted to charge us for any service or changes possible. We were on the phone for 1.5 hours while other flights that we could have booked were getting sold out - the customer service person would take 15-20 minutes (for real) to search up each question or option we asked about. It has been a frustrating experience - we lost time and money and it ruined our holidays completely. We then demanded to speak to the manager, who again did not want to take any accountability for their team and gave us a small discount on the cancellation fee. In total, we were on the phone with them for 2 days back and forth, without any resolutions. We felt misguided and misinformed with their unfair policies towards their customers. We did not feel taken care of at all. We had to pay the price for the misinformation and the flights we did not cancel ourselves. After all this trouble, we spent Christmas without our family and the missed the urgent reasons we were travelling for. "
165,"✅ Trip Verified |  Old A320 with narrow pitch. Flight perfectly on time, with constant announcements from cockpit. Friendly staff, free chips and water. Quick luggage delivery at T5."
166,"✅ Trip Verified |  Another BA Shambles. Started off well with excellent check in at first at t5, mid afternoon so avoided the early morning, evening scrum. Into the Concorde lounge, excellent service again. Great choice of cocktails, wine etc. Food ok a bit overcooked but pretty reasonable. Called to the boarding gate. Chaos, people jostling for position to get on the plane. People with children under 5 called before the 8 people in first bankrolling the flight and most of them well over 5. We get on to be told that none of the lights in first can be dimmed at all, so the lights were on all night. It was like being detained and interrogated! Excellent wine and champagne selection. Dinner menu handed out. I’ll have the prawn cocktail to start please. No you won’t as they’ve only loaded one for 8 people and the guy in 1A got it. I bet he felt like he’d won the lottery. Ok I’ll have the beef wellington, basically a freezing slice of beef with some lettuce. Mains,  I’ll have the curry, no you won’t as they’ve substituted that with Christmas dinner.  I’m going to the Maldives to get away from Christmas. I ended up with short ribs that were inedible, no salad starter, no water offered, no bread roll. I just couldn’t eat it. So basically my husband and I have spent £20,000 on 2 return seats to be blinded by lights on and left starving. No apologies. Watch out BA as Virgin start flying direct in October. As always you rest on your laurels and treat your customers like idiots."
167,"Not Verified |  BA cancelled my flight home to Heathrow on Dec 19th. On the face of it, that was sensible as the weather in Iceland was appalling. However, what was not acceptable was that the flight was cancelled only 4 hours before take off time by which time I was already struggling through dreadful driving conditions to get to the airport. I got nowhere near before the conditions became too bad. If they had taken advice they would have spared everyone the need to try and travel on roads that all ended up closed. I am now booked onto the flight on the 21st and downgraded for my sins. Having checked today, as I type they have not cancelled the flight on the 20th despite the road to Keflavík being closed! Do they not check these things? Any help from BA offered - not really."
168,"Not Verified |  BA cancelled my flight home, the last flight of the day into Heathrow, and tried to push me onto another flight to London City 3 hours later! My car was at Heathrow. I didn't want to try and cross London late at night on public transport with luggage, especially as there were rail strikes announced around that time. I had to book a flight home with Lufthansa which cost €500 for an economy seat, but at least it got me home to Heathrow (all be it another terminal) on the Friday night so I could get home to family. I still have had no news on a refund of the €500 2 months on. It's such a shame, flying BA used to be such a pleasurable experience. BA have cancelled or moved one leg of every journey we've booked this year. We are regrettably have to use other airlines now which have much better reliability and customer service."
169,"✅ Trip Verified | Turned up 3.5 hours in advance, Terminal 5 at London Heathrow was already carnage, 100s of people trying to check in, only 5 desks manned. Long queues at security due to only 4 lines open. People stressed, pushing, shouting, and flight delayed by 2 hours, according to pilot delay due to suitcases all needing to be loaded. Missed connecting flight in Doha, 12 hours wait til next one. Received a voucher, approx £6 for the whole day. Arrived 1 day later, my suitcase didn’t arrive with me. Filed a claim at the desk, for 5 days no update, no information, no offer of compensation and no solution offer. I now have a spoilt holiday, many personal belongings are gone, xmas gifts missing, extensive expenses I don’t know if I will be reimbursed. Beware with BA, expect low level or zero customer service, old planes, and zero help if anything goes wrong or missing. I will personally avoid BA in future at all costs."
170,"Not Verified |  Boarding – at gate at LGW they called Group 1 to board (we were World Traveller Plus & Group 3), then called ""anyone in Groups 2-6"", whereupon everyone else surged forward. Why have numbered boarding groups if you don’t use them. Cabin crew - Treated passengers as an inconvenience as they moved about the plane. At one point a passenger was coming out of the toilet as a crew member approached and the crew member just pushed the door closed pushing them back into the toilet as they went past, and without even a word. No acknowledgement when you stood aside to let them past. Service – We were in the final row of six in WT+ (which has a total of 48 seats). The lunch meal was brought out and we were the last people to be served (not unusual for back row seats) but when it came to us there was only the vegetarian option left of the 3 menu options. Cabin steward said that they had only been given 48 WT+ meals. There was a second hot meal served before we landed. Again, the same server got to us last and again there was only a vegetarian option left. I asked if it might not have been possible to commence serving this second meal from back to front so that we had a choice for at least one meal, and she said she hadn’t thought of that! Food – Some of it was inedible. Vegetarian Cannelloni had pasta so thick and uncooked neither of us could eat it. The bread roll was crispy like toast in the bottom half and soft in the top half. Only thing I could eat was the Baby Bel! In between meal snacks consisted of a 2 biscuit pack of shortbread, pretty basic. Drinks – They ran out of red wine 4 hours into an 11-hour flight. Toilets – There was no toilet accessible directly from the WT+ section. We had to walk halfway down the plane through Economy to reach a shared toilet. We flew Virgin Atlantic 2 months before in equivalent (Premium Economy) and it was so much better. Organised boarding, sparkling wine or orange on boarding (water or orange in BA), food options available (even in last row seats), better food, proper glasses/cups for drinks, dedicated toilet access, help yourself snacks, helpful service from cabin crew. We will not be looking to fly BA over Virgin in future."
171,"✅ Trip Verified |  Missing baggage customer service was the worst I’ve ever experienced. I arrived back in Phoenix on Sunday evening and air tags showed my bags arrived on Monday, but it took three more days before they were finally delivered. I understood that due to delays caused by freezing fog in London my luggage did not make it onto my final flight. I filled out the required form at the Phoenix airport and then attempted to fill one out online where I received a message saying that the bags had already been reported missing and to enter the tracking code that had been sent to me via email, but no email was received. I made phone calls daily and was told a message was sent and I should hear back within 24 hours. Finally the email with the tracking number was received on Tuesday night. I went online with the tracking number on Wednesday and it requested that I provide the same information that I had given them on the form at the airport. My luggage was finally delivered on Thursday afternoon. "
172,"✅ Trip Verified |  British Airways are not the flag carrier they used to be. The check-in staff at the Club Europe area did not display any premium service and did not provide a good overall service.  The Galleries South Lounge was very busy, but the food was very good. There is a good array of salads, pasta, bread, and hot food available. The festive Turkey and Ham pie was particularly good. The flight was delayed as LHR was very busy on a Tuesday evening. The boarding process was stressful due to the lack of any queue management system and the majority of passengers congregating around the gate. Despite BA using a group system to board, it took almost 1hr to board 240 passengers. The flight itself was good, with a good Club meal service. The bar service was good but it seems that BA have done away with champagne on-board and also in the lounge. A menu is handed out prior to departure with a good food offering for the length of flight. The food was very good, with beef cheek served with vegetables being chosen. BA have always excelled with their catering and this has not changed. The seat is a standard economy seat, with a table in the middle seat for Club Europe, a standard practice for BA. The seat was comfortable, but with limited leg room. The cabin was clean, presentable, and tidy with no issues. The A321 featured Wi-Fi which contains a very good landing page with flight information, access to the Speedbird Cafe menu, access to BA.com, and a good pricing strategy for wither just messaging or streaming also. Overall, the airline is still a good world player, but with clear improvements needed with their ground staff. The cabin manager was very good, but the other crew in Club did not display the expected behaviours in business class. She kept touching her face, not making eye contact with passengers, and seemed uninterested and like she did not want to be there."
173,"✅ Trip Verified |  Stupidly tried BA again after a five year gap and paid over £7000 for my wife and I to go to Barbados because I thought the new Business Class layout might rival Virgin Atlantic on the route. About six months ago BA announced they were switching planes to the old antique push-me-pull-you layout but it was too late to reorganise our holiday logistics. Sure enough we suffered the most appallingly uncomfortable flights with no room (eight seats across), worn out fittings, inedible food and surly FAs."
174,Not Verified |  Seat horribly narrow; 3-4-3 on a 777. Thankfully the flight was only a quarter full so was able to stretch out. Food and beverage service was good and it was great having a proper beer not a cup of froth that overflows! Cabin crew very good. Booked as a BA ticket that included travel on Qatar Airways as well.
175,"✅ Trip Verified |  Glasgow to London delayed by 1 hour. My wife and I now accept that a BA flight will be late and delayed. Very rarely on time. As long as you accept this, you won’t be disappointed planning ahead. There’s a high risk of delays. If you are connecting with another airline with OneWorld it’s extremely risky."
176,"✅ Trip Verified |  When I tried to check in online, I was offered an upgrade to premium economy for just under £300. I decided to take it, but then the website wouldn't allow me to choose seats or to check in. I phoned BA and was happy that the call was picked up quickly, but I was then told that because I had changed my booking, I had to check in at the airport. So we turned up three hours before the flight, only to be told that our two adjacent aisle seats in economy had been switched to the middle seats in a row of four in premium. The check-in agent was helpful but couldn't fix and suggested we try the BA desk airside. That desk was understaffed but when we did reach the front of the line, we were told to try at the boarding gate. At the gate, we finally managed to get one aisle seat and one window, not sitting together. After going through that, the flight was surprisingly good, with decent food and very good service. We flew back economy, which wasn't too bad either. The flight attendants were friendly and enthusiastic, and Emma and Daniel, who looked after us, could not have been better. I've obviously learned my lesson about late BA upgrades, but everything else was good."
177,"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew from Prague to LHR. Excellent service, attentive staff, first drink service, then meal service (choice of three meals), later second drink service. In reality - excellent flight. Couple of days later I flew back from LHR to Prague. Boarding at LHR T5 was a total chaos. Onboard service cannot really be called service: No curtain between business and economy class (which later caused people endlessly passing to get to the toilet). Meal service could not get more unprofessional - 5 rows took two guys nearly 30 mins to serve. Constantly interrupted (no people passing to the toilets at this time yet). I don´t know if there was any meal choice as no one bothers talking to you. I was served that  afternoon tea consisting of three canapes-like bites and some drink. Why would we bother serving you also a scone. Hardly after 5 mins plates to be taken away - when I asked for my scone it came as a surprise I was not served any (no co-ordination between the crew).  Crew busy chatting at the galley. In reality - the service could not get any worse. One just must ask what do you pay the premium price for? "
178,"✅ Trip Verified |  Disappointing again especially on business. The service is ancient, one world lounges are a catastrophe at Heathrow. Business class seat is similar to economy and electronics are very poor onboard. "
179,✅ Trip Verified |  During both the outbound and return flights we were not offered a decent meal. We received a tiny bag of chips and a very small bottle of water. What outraged us the most is that during the return flight we couldn't even order any food / drink because the card reader didn't function. The first and last time we'll fly with BA.
180,"✅ Trip Verified |  I was flying to Warsaw for one day of meetings and would be flying back out to Miami the next day. Initially my flight was delayed in Denver by 3 hours. As such I knew I would miss my connection in Warsaw. The Denver to Heathrow flight was terrible. The plane was dirty, I was in economy, I usually fly business or Premium Economy but on this flight there was no availability. The plane was only about 2/3 full and the service was not good. My food was inedible and the seats very cramped although the middle seat was open so that made it tolerable. When i arrived in Heathrow it was a complete circus. Passengers everywhere trying to rebook missed connections. Not only my flight but multiple other flights had missed connections. After waiting in line for an hour I was finally rebooked on another BA flight to Warsaw. This plane was the smallest 3x3 plane I have seen. Packed in like sardines. My bag never showed up so i had to cancel my meeting and now have no bag to fly back to Miami. BA has shown no desire to help other than to give me standard answers and that hopefully my bag will show up in Miami at some point and I can retrieve it from there. I mean the bag is sitting in Heathrow somewhere with 6 different fight options to get it to Warsaw yet BA in unwilling to do anything to expedite getting my bag to Warsaw before I leave for Miami the next day. "
181,"✅ Trip Verified |  Booked a BA holiday to Marrakech, after posting a negative review regarding my double tier points credit, I can now confirm that the points have been credited. It took a while but BA did eventually make good on their promise, thank you. Based on things now being resolved I have travelled on BA since and I am booked to travel to South Africa in First class on 2nd January, looking forward to the new BA Concorde lounge. Keep it up BA, loyalty is indeed a 2way street."
182,"✅ Trip Verified | Extremely sub-par service. Highlights: No online meal selection. Staff pretty much dropped off whatever meal they had and were very rude if a passenger wanted it changed. Last meal was delayed to the last 40 minutes of flight. Plates were literally grabbed away. I had to hand over my unfinished plate that the staff again dropped on me. No apology. No offer of a napkin. I had to scrounge for a piece of paper to clean my jacket. None of the passengers were told to straighten up their seats before meal. Because the seat before me was so tilted, I could barely keep the plate on the tray without things slipping off. Staff walked down with some water and biscuits. This got exhausted just before she got to me. She just looked at me and walked away. Nothing further was offered."
183,"✅ Trip Verified |  I virtually gave up on British Airways about three years ago, writing off my Avios and opting for other airlines. But my return flights from Heathrow to Lisbon this week were very good. The aircraft were pretty much full, but the service was excellent and the food surprisingly good. A particular shout-out to a flight attendant called Jo, but all the teams there and back were enthusiastic and attentive. I'm going to have to start spending those Avios."
184,"✅ Trip Verified |  I was pleasantly surprised that the airline could maintain a steady schedule with little delay considering the time of the year and the weather. The flight from Montreal was my return flight to Scotland, but I originally booked to fly to and from Toronto, but the airline helped me cancel and I rebooked for a cheaper flight. The inflight service was pretty decent andthey do offer a blanket and pillow. As well they walk through the cabin offering drinks and handing out a small snack prior to the leading meal service. While the food was typical air plane food. I thoroughly enjoyed my flight and had no issues at all with my flights."
185,"✅ Trip Verified |  British Airways is late, their website is atrocious, and they wouldn't let me check-in until 24 hours before the flight. I have been trying for 6 hours to check in through their website, and/or find a real person to speak with. Customer service had such a thick accent I didn't think they were speaking English. "
186,✅ Trip Verified | Flew from Amman to London on Nov. 14 2022. Not sure what type of aircraft it was. My Ticket was economy plus. The flight is 5h35m. We received exactly 250ml of water and about 10 potato chips. The seats did not recline and there was no entertainment system. Any other food or drink had to be purchased. So we couldn't even get a warm cup of coffee or teas. It is the third time I have flown with BA recently and was unhappy each time but did not write a review. Will honestly never fly them again if I can help it.
187,"✅ Trip Verified | This is the worst experience I have ever had with any airline. I flew with British Airline on August 21st 2022. I had one checked bag that was lost at Heathrow Airport. I am aware that at that time there was a system error with the baggage belt and many travelers were affected. I filed a report for my missing bag on the same day I arrived at LAX airport, and that was on August 21st. I waited patiently for three weeks (which is the time frame to either find the bag or be eligible for a compensation). When I did not receive any update on my lost bag, I filed a claim for compensation, and that was on September 11th. Since then, I have been waiting for a response from the customer relation with no good signs of resolving the issue. I emailed them and tried to update the claim but still no response until today. I contacted the baggage team and they were not helpful and did not ease my prolonged waiting. The only way to contact customer relations is via the website and they're not even getting back to me. Every time I talk to a customer service agent, they tell me to wait some more. I have been waiting for almost three months now and my issue is not resolved yet. This whole experience was a hassle. Very unprofessional for a renowned airline like BA."
188,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flying LHR T5 to CPT November 2022:  BA app and website not working properly - would not load my ticket. LHR T5 smooth and calm. Checking process quick. - But boarding card would not scan at security, they gave me one for someone else to a different destination.  Ran back to checkin to get correct one. Bags also tagged incorrectly and had disappeared.  Someone ran off to find my bags in the depths of T5 and retag them (amazingly they did show up in Cape Town).  Told only main lounge was open not B and C pier lounges. Turns out this was false information ... B Pier lounge was open. But I was in main lounge which was overcrowded and worn out. -Arrived late to the gate (train not working). There was a Biz class lane (quick) but then a giant queue to get on the plane as they only had one airbridge, not two. Seat comfy and cabin clean but the sinks were taped up as the waste was not working. I was offered hand sanitiser instead but this is disgusting (imagine going to the bathroom and not being able to wash your hands as there is no sink). Unbelievable that BA dispatches planes in this condition. Food average. Wine served way too late (choice of wine with cold food, or eat food first and matching wines come a quarter of an hour later). Overall experience 2/10. Flew Air France (Fortalaza to CDG to LHR) two weeks earlier which was way better. How embarrassing for BA."
189,"Not Verified | Worst experience ever. Outbound flight was cancelled and I was not notified. I was rebooked on a very uncomfortable trip. Inbound flight delayed 1 hour, also not notified. On top of it, they boarded my hand luggage, which was the only bag I had. Extra wait in Milan then. Food is horrible."
190,"✅ Trip Verified |  Check in was a shambles at BWI, just 3 counters open for a very full flight. The bag drop queue was even longer than the regular check-in queue! Boarding was done by zones so that was carried out reasonably well. Once on board, the FAs were fine, not as engaging on my outbound flight to IAD. The aircraft was cramped and the seats in economy were horrible. I was seated in an aisle seat (row F) where there is an entertainment box taking up a third of your legroom. Overall, very cramped seat, poor legroom and awful IFE screens. The meal was mediocre and there was no bar service before the meal this time. On lading, we were served a hot sandwich which had oozing cheese all over the wrapper so it was not pleasant to handle but tasted very good! The plane landed at a remote stand which meant that we had to be bussed to T5 and since it was raining, it was not a nice experience. Overall, I rate this just as a mediocre journey."
191,✅ Trip Verified | Beyond disgusted with the fact that my baggage has yet to be delivered to me after 5 weeks of emails and calls to BA. Two pieces reported 29th September. BA responses are generic non specific and all attempts to speak to a customer service worker are obstructed. All this from an airline touting its values and claiming yo be one of the best in the world. Disgraceful does not fully describe their customer service.
192,"✅ Trip Verified | On July 19th 2022 I had submitted a complaint form with regards to the fact that BA had misplaced our luggage during our wedding trip to Italy and we've lost 2 days and incurred additional expenses in retrieving them, for which I had provided all copy of receipts for. I requested for my expenses to be reimbursed, they agreed, I sent all requested information and was told in 2 weeks I will be receiving it. It's 4 months later and British Airways has not processed my reimbursements and stopped answering my follow-ups on the matter."
193,"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked the flight on Oct 8, but have to cancel the flight on the same day after learning that I can't get my entry visa in time for the flight. And I did receive a confirmation email says my flight was canceled. But in the cancellation email, the booking reference number is a different one. So I requested cancellation, but BA canceled another person's flight and sent the confirmation to my email? I assumed that my flight was canceled, but after more than 3 weeks, I still have not received any refund, so I reached out, and it turned out my flight is still on?! And it is getting even more ridiculous when you try to reach out to BA. I tried multiple different ways, phone calls, and emails, but none was able to investigate what actually happened nor has the authority help cancel my flight without paying penalty. Based on my experience, no ones reads your email carefully, no matter how much context you put in. Given all I have experienced, I have zero faith in British Airways."
194,✅ Trip Verified |  London to Gibraltar on 25th October 2022. I booked my flight several months ahead of travel and was rather disappointed by the experience.  BA attempt to nickle and dime the customers with outrageous seat selection prices. Offering of a very small bottle of water and a nutribar as a breakfast and one gains the impression of where BA aim to be positioned at of late. The A320 has was no inflight entertainment or a route map. The staff disappeared for most of the flight. The flight was punctual but I felt cheated and under whelmed by the experience. 
195,"Not Verified |  I’ve generally been a loyal Gold status flyer with BA if they fly the route I’m after but my recent flight to Nairobi was about as abysmal as you can get. We should have departed at 10:20 but after continuous delays finally left 4.5 hours late, not ideal when you’ve then got an 8hr + flight. Staff informed us virtually as we took off that the meal and drinks service would be started and completed asap as they needed to get rest because of hours we had been delayed. They couldn’t get it out and away quickly enough. That was then basically the last you saw of them until they came around an hour or so before landing. I sincerely hope they enjoyed their rest because when you pay full fare for business class service you actually expect a service. They were all extremely miserable and clearly didn’t want to be on board. We’re still waiting for you to pay our compensation that has been awarded to us by the official ombudsman in July for the cancellation of our flight to Miami in March. This was cancelled at 3am for the 2:30 pm flight !"
196,"✅ Trip Verified |  A great flight. The suites on this aircraft really provide maximum comfort. British has returned to full service so meals were coursed, menus and hot towels provided…etc Food was quite good with choices provided for both meals. Service was ok, I prefer to have the same person serving me rather than a hodge pudge but that’s my preference. Entertainment was good as was connectivity. No real complaints except a minor one. The tray table seemed far from me while eating in its closest position. I actually felt like I was in a true business class, not by Qatar’s standards, but that’s another story."
197,"✅ Trip Verified |  I am happy to say that this flight was quite good. Except for the second rate Euro business seating, everything was very well done. A friendly, informative cabin crew served a good hot breakfast while being very communicative to folks nervous about Heathrow transit. Well done. Unfortunately, a bus gate was used upon arrival."
198,"✅ Trip Verified |  Just a few years ago flying on BA was enjoyable, but times have changed. These days about five hours on board the plane is no fun at all. The Terminal 5 experience still feels classy, and on the way out it felt well staffed and efficient. On board though, it’s just become an experience to be endured. BA’s mean decision to split seats into nicer for the first half of the plane, and nastier for the rest underlines this. There is no entertainment, no magazine. Refreshment purchases are brought to the seat after ordering from an app. There is no attempt to provide fresh or hot food on the day, despite the competition being able to do this. Is it too much to ask for, when trapped on board for five hours? You get a free tiny bottle of water and a small cereal bar. On the outbound flight the crew collected rubbish just once before landing, but helpfully tied a bag around a toilet door down the back in case anyone wanted to fight their way past and clear things up themselves. Recline buttons have been deleted on the seats and the seat pitch feels squeezed. On the return flight, for one reason or another due to BA’s delays from the previous day, we were just under two hours late getting off the plane late in the evening and some passengers couldn’t travel at all because there were not enough crew. The cabin crew were nonetheless distinctly more professional on this flight. Altogether, I would say good things if there were any - but it’s hard to think of anything I could recommend BA for; and that is a pity, because it used to be a professional company to deal with and a pleasure worth looking forward to when making European journeys."
199,"✅ Trip Verified |  A very positive experience with BA. Seats were new style club seats and very comfortable for sleep. Food was fine but not outstanding. Wi-Fi good, and video screen large and bright. Baggage came out very quickly at Heathrow, had the same experience on the return flight to Atlanta. All in all, would fly BA again, but would probably want to make sure it is new seats."
200,"✅ Trip Verified | Baby across the aisle cried nonstop and crew yakked in the galley so on this long flight there was no possibility for any sleep or even rest. Mentioning to a crew member that their colleagues were talking loudly made no difference at all. My second meal was something inedible, no way to get a simple bag of crisps or nuts, instead an assortment of dried something. Baggage took 3/4 hour to be delivered and had no priority for Club or even First passengers; we were all kept waiting after many economy bags had been delivered. A380 is a great aircraft but the BA seating is still the very tired old yin/yang configuration with some people stuck in the middle of 3 seats (probably not what anyone is expecting in business class these days)"
201,"✅ Trip Verified |  Evening flight from LHR to IAD on an A380. Check in at T5 is poor, most of their kiosks don't work well and staff have to be called. Boarding was very poorly managed. The ground staff were overwhelmed because it was a full flight and were struggling to manage passengers. The gate was small and there was insufficient seating for such a big aircraft. The flight was full and it left 50 minutes late but the pilot kept us informed on this issue. Once airborne, service started quite quickly and the cabin crew were very pleasant and helpful. They did their job very professionally and efficiently. They answered the call bells promptly and nothing was too much trouble. They started out with a bar service and were generous with drinks and then came the meal service and the food was very good. The IFE was old and clunky but had sufficient movies and TV programmes for a 7.5 hour flight. The seat was comfortable but legroom was tight. All in, it was an uneventful journey and I would give it the thumbs up but ground services needs attention."
202,"✅ Trip Verified |  We boarded our flight at Edinburgh to London for our connecting flight to San Francisco on 4th October, there were a lot of Americas heading back to America from Scotland because of the Open Golf at St Andrews. The woman at the counter was rude, I was actually embarrassed to be British at the time. Shouting, snapping at people and just had a real horrible way about her. On the flight from London to San Francisco, prior to the 24 hour check in, I spent £150+ to reserve two seats for our once in a life time holiday to America. Once we boarded, it was evident that the seat I was sitting in was broken. The recliner button was not working and had been pushed into the frame of the arm rest. I asked the flight attendant at the time of there was anything that could be done, but not only was she also rude, but seemed uninterested in that fact that I was going to have to sit for 11 hours on a flight with a seat that wouldn't recline. I eventually got the flight to state that she would report the fault, only to find out that multiple other seats on the economy seating area were also broken. Attitude with British Airways staff has been absolutely horrendous. So, after getting off the flight, I decided to make a complaint to British Airways. Bearing in mind that I had paid £150+ for the privilege of picking a seat. I asked for a refund for the cost of the booking of the seat prior to the 24 hour check in, only to be told no, they don't do refunds. I paid for a product that was broken, met with nothing but rude staff, and they are telling me they can't refund the cost of booking the seat? 4 emails to the customer team and they are still refusing, they are also refusing to tell me whether or not that the fault was reported prior to me sitting in that seat. All they have now offered me is a £50 BA voucher, which I declined on the basis that if they picked my seats (for example I hadn't payed for the seats prior to the 24 hour check in) then a £50 voucher would be ok, but not when I have spent my own money to select a seat that was broken. After all my experiences with BA, I will not be using them again. Very rude and unhelpful staff and I will chose another carrier in the future, im actually ashamed that BA treats people the way they do when they are a national airline for Great Britain."
203,"✅ Trip Verified |  While entering the aircraft it was very rushed no smooth boarding people were struggling with cabin luggage and finding their seats and heating was high that I was suffocating. I got faint due to that heat, but the cabin crew were very helping so all the thanks to those who helped me at that time. Other then that when I called cabin crew to ask for some water they took half an hour to response. "
204,"Not Verified |  LHR-LAX. I prefer the Boeing 777 over the A380 as the seats don't seem too cramped. Check-in was very easy with the kiosks as was bag drop and security at Heathrow. T5 is a whole other story. Once through security its up the escalator, up the stairs, up the elevator, down the escalator get to the gate, no seating, then down an escalator and finally down the jet bridge to the plane. I have been in and out of Heathrow many times but never in T5 before. Anyway cabin crew were pleasant; drinks and meal service were fine. It was a day flight so no real sleeping and passengers were all moving around most of the flight. The entertainment system was good with decent options, so I occupied my time with several movies. Nice landing at LAX. All in all BA was just fine."
205,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew back to UK from Miami in new Club World Suite - a huge improvement on the elderly Yin and Yang style Club World. Boarding easy. Took off 1/2 hour late due to delayed incoming aircraft but made up this time on way back and landed on time. Very comfortable suite with plenty of storage for bits and pieces. Bedding and large pillow supplied. Attentive FA's - especially Anna who addressed me by name). However, let down by very average catering (not very good short rib beef and underwhelming salmon for my wife). And, sadly, once again a very poor choice of films on the IFE which let down the excellent 17inch touch screen. Refused to pay BA's extortionate pre-pay to book your seat fees, and still got 2 seats together. C'mon BA - do we not pay enough already to travel Club Class ? I can recommend BA's new Club Class and we will travel this way - if we can afford it - in future."
206,✅ Trip Verified |  I flew with hand baggage but security at Dubai was quick. Entered lounge which was a bit small but good and drink offerings sound. Flight on A380 left on time. Few technical issues with IFE which would have been really irritating had it been a day flight. Decent snack and slept well. Arrivals lounge excellent. Would recommend.
207,"Not Verified | London to Cairo. First, on this 5 hour mid morning flight the only complimentary food and drink were a tiny bag of pretzels and a small bottle of water. Even Southwest is more generous. When unable to connect my phone to order food, I hit the FA call button with no response for more than an hour. When the FA came to collect garbage I had to show him the call light and he gruffly asked me what was the matter. He used his phone to place the order."
208,"✅ Trip Verified |  This review is specifically about Maddie, crew member who took care of us. She was attentive, warm, friendly and nothing was too much trouble. Smiling from start to finish. She should be the brand ambassador for BA."
209,"✅ Trip Verified |  5 hours in a cramped single aisle aircraft, no inflight entertainment. In economy there is no free catering other than a bottle of water a packet of crisps and a minimal selection of food items for purchase."
210,"Not Verified |  DFW-LHR. Had an easy transfer at DFW from American Airlines to British Airways heading to London. First ride on an A380 left me with the feeling that this plane type won't ever be my first choice. Was seated upstairs where the cabin space seemed very roomy, but the seats and rows were very cramped. When the passenger in front reclined the back of the seat was 7 inches from my face and I had a real difficult time trying to view the seat back entertainment screen. The seat itself wasn't too bad but I felt squished and locked in. On a plus side, having a window seat gave me this nice storage area by my side. Ground staff were pleasant and cabin crew were really nice. Plenty of beverages offered and multiple water runs were made during the night. Dinner was rubbish as was the morning pre-landing snack. The entertainment system was very responsive and had a pretty good selection of movies, tv, music and games. All in all it was an OK experience and did get me to London on time and our baggage arrived safely, but I'm not sold on the A380. T5 at LHR is another story that will be in a different review. What a mess that place is."
211,✅ Trip Verified |  Check in at Jersey straightforward. There is a small business class lounge at Jersey with reasonable drinks range and some limited food. Flight boarded on time but take off was delayed due to poor visibility at LHR. Captain kept us well informed and we eventually took off 50 mins behind schedule with a 20 minute late arrival at Heathrow. Good service from the cabin crew and a bacon roll and coffee served. Disappointing that the wait for cases at Heathrow T5 was as long as the flight!
212,"✅ Trip Verified |  Check in at LHR T5 was very quick and queue for security short. We used the South Lounge which was supposed to be the quieter at the time, but was very busy and difficult for our group of 3 to get seated together. Flight boarded on time. Whilst this is only a short flight (35 mins) the service of the cabin crew was outstanding. Glass of champagne, Coronation Chicken Salad and a coffee all served with a smile and a little banter. In spite of some of the issues with BA, their cabin crew are usually exceptional and this was no exception. Flight landed on time and bags delivered quite promptly."
213,"✅ Trip Verified | The check-in process was smooth. I got access to the IGA Lounge which was nice, but not as nice has the Turkish Airlines Lounge. On board was what all this flight was about. This was my first time flying Intra-European Business Class, and though I was well prepared, I still found it underwhelming. First, the seat is just a normal economy seat, with the middle seat blocked off. There is no personal IFE, so basically no entertainment for a 3-hour flight. Meal service was very slow, and by the time it reached half of the business class cabin, one of the 2 choices ran out, plus the meal was not as good as the economy meal I got on my Turkish Airlines flight a few days ago. I could see that staff did their best, but since there were 32 business class passengers on a single aisle aircraft with a small galley, there was so much they could do. Also, the 32 passengers shared one single WC, meaning a long line for the bath room, something I have rarely seen in business class. Arrived at LHR, we did not get a contact gate, but the thing was that there was no bus either, and the crew announced that they had no idea when the bus would come. It finally came, of course, and the delay was more on the airport than the airline, but since BA is the main operator at Heathrow T5, such things will affect their reputation."
214,"✅ Trip Verified | This is my first time flying BA's new Club Suite, which, in my opinion, is very good. Flight to the US, including mine, departed from concourse C of Terminal 5 which did not have many shopping or dining options. However, it was quiet so finding seating was quite easy. The highlight is the Club Suite, which is spacious and provides a great deal of privacy. Meal service was slow, and everything was served on one tray, all at once. I think now is the time for them to begin to get back to pre-pandemic standard. At least the food tasted good, which was not something I previously experienced on BA flights, even in First Class."
215,"✅ Trip Verified |  My 7am flight for a conference in June was cancelled with less than 12h notice - without being given any alternative flight or rebook me upon alternative flight. Upon calling customer service, customer service who said she can only get me a flight 2 days later. They did not work with me as I miss 2 days of conference. They asked me to travel to a different airport in Sweden (Stockholm); which I reluctantly agreed to as I was not given any other choice - but I had to pay for that domestic flight myself. Upon reaching the Gothenburg airport on the day of departure, I saw a direct flight to Heathrow, called customer service and was told there is 1 seat available. So I changed to 8.15am from Gothenburg - Heathrow - Jersey. However, at this point BA told me I have to pay a fee of GBP 710 as I “changed my flight a 2nd time”.  I find it a disgrace that BA charge a fee to change a flight that they cancelled, and they were unable to give alternative options to reach my destination in for the conference. BA proposed that I travel to another airport in Sweden at my own expense. I have since contacted BA for the legal compensation I’m entitled to according to UK law, but I got a rejection as they claim I arranged my own travel to my destination. If I have a choice, I will never travel BA again. Such awful customer service and complete lack of understanding of customer needs."
216,"Not Verified |  I would like to thank all the air and cabin crew for having the best experience with a very long journey! I don’t know how you manage to keep smiling. Couldn’t fault anything. Helpful, reassuring, excellent food and I can’t wait to fly again. Thank you and I really appreciated you."
217,"✅ Trip Verified |  British Airways personnel was just magnificent. My flight into London was delayed, security had long lines, I ran like a madman to find the gate closed but the plane was still there… the lady at the gate worked the computer at 200 miles an hour to allow me to board (the software program was already closed). This while the flight manager, who came towards the gate, urging her to make a decision since the plane was about to loose its take off spot in line. I was sweating from the run, still out of breath while she handed me my passport giving me the green light to board. I bolted again into the plane feeling bad that I did not personally thank her for her magic. I really hope she gets recognized by British Airways for her performance. Thank you for all you do !"
218,Not Verified |  Good flight apart from my seat fabric was coming apart on39J and lack of good leg room. Meal was good from Singapore. Should be more snacks on board. My neighbours passenger charger and headphone socket didn’t work.
219,✅ Trip Verified |  Flight was 1 hour late leaving gate. Crew were friendly. Seats comfortable. But the complimentary snack provided was a bag of ready salted crisps.
220,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Istanbul. British Airways Business Class rows comprise of three seats with the middle seat empty. Front rows about 5-7 are considered as Business Class, with very short leg space.  No pillows, no blanket, horrible inflight service, staff were harassing me. No curtesy for business Class check-in while waiting for flights. "
221,Not Verified | London to Manchester. British Airways is probably the worst air company I have ever flown with they took 2 hours to unload the luggage and the flight was delayed by an hour. The staff were no help and frankly rude.
222,Not Verified |  Flight was cancelled at the last minute due to “weather” despite pretty much all other flights not being affected. Booked onto a flight the next day. Arrived at the airport 2.5 hours ahead T5. Horrendous check-in and security delays meant we almost missed the new flight. The flight was fine once we got on it but the damage was done.
223,"✅ Trip Verified |  After having a few not so good experiences in the past, I feel I have to write a positive review as well where it is deserved. First of all, the improvement in the BA lounge in Gatwick is massive. The buffet was a joy. We flew on a BA flight but operated by Iberia Express. Wonderful staff and the food was exceptional. Whoever brought in this change of food supplier ... congratulations! Also may I add that this time business class was not 11 rows like last time, but 5 rows which was definitely a big improvement and could be felt in a much more attentive service. I am still not clear on luggage being labelled ""priority"". The luggage certainly does not come out first in the destination airports."
224,"Not Verified |  This review is for BA booking system not a flight . Today I clicked wrong date on line, my mistake and expect to pay a fee. I then go to “cancel booking” and click on the option to not receive a voucher, immediately I received a response saying my voucher is on its way. I call them and speak to a gentleman who continuously spoke over me and would not listen to my concerns and eventually I give up and want to book a new flight, obviously at a much higher price but using the voucher I didn’t want. However to my surprise I am unable to use this voucher because they can’t tell me what it is until I receive it at a point in the future that they can’t say when. So they now have my money and I have to re-book at full cost. In the end in order to get me off the phone they hung up."
225,✅ Trip Verified |  Manchester to Seattle via London. I will never fly BA again. They cancelled my return flight from Heathrow back to Manchester and then cancelled the alternative offered. We had to get our son come all the way to London to pick us up and take us to our car in Manchester. The food was terrible and on the return journey as soon as they had finished serving they were round taking our trays so that they could settle down for the night. I will not be flying BA again
226,"✅ Trip Verified |  Our flight in March 2022 from San Francisco to London on 28th March was cancelled with 3 hours’ notice. We found out on the shuttle bus to the airport. We had to stay overnight for the next day flight. We still have not been recompensed for our expenses (filled in on line) and have received no replies on follow-ups. It is the usual 30 min or longer time to wait on customer service picking up. During this trip, we had to re-schedule a return flight (my wife was ill). This should not have been a problem as the flights were re-bookable. We were given a voucher. This voucher was only bookable by phone. When I phoned to rebook, we got the automated voice saying BA were not taking flight bookings by phone. You can see the problem - how do a use a voucher where I must phone and they are not taking phone bookings ? All I have been offered is another voucher. The time to use has passed. It must be great to be a business that can print endless A4 vouchers and not return money paid for services not rendered. We returned home with Aer Lingus with no drama."
227,"Not Verified |  I sat in seat 25C. Our Cabin Crew lady was called Gina and she went above and beyond to keep the customers happy. She greeted us as we boarded with a very cheery smile, she engaged with two families travelling with young children and gave out games and books. Her trolley service was excellent and she took great care in what she was doing. She had time for a quick chat and I think she said she was half German and half Bulgarian, a really lovely young lady who is a credit to British Airways."
228,"✅ Trip Verified |  Full afternoon flight. Ready to fly on time. Arrived early. Uneventful flight. Good service. Pre dinner drinks. Drink with meal. Coffee, Drinks available at back. AVML meal was tasty. Hard working crew on a full flight. Audio worked well."
229,"✅ Trip Verified |  I was told I'd require a 48 hr negative covid test for entry into Philippines. Booked my trip via BA.com, with a transfer in Singapore. They delay my transfer to the next day, okay, not too bothered as have my 48 hr negative covid test, but when I try to check in at Changi Airport, the Philippines Airlines check in staff require a 24 hr negative covid test. Had to rush to a different terminal, get tested, wait for the result, rush back to check in ...the gate had closed.  Had to book an extra night in Singapore hotel, book my own flight to Manila, then also the return journey back to London. If one misses one leg of a BA booked flight, the remaining flights get cancelled.  I discovered Oman Air Business Class and better then British Airways, from treating their customers, quality of service, the business class experience."
230,"✅ Trip Verified |  Having been promised help to find a hotel room after an outgoing flight from Heathrow was running very late and my hotel would be closed, I boarded the plane on this basis. I was subsequently dumped at Barcelona airport at 0038 to sleep the night on the floor. There was no help at there to find a hotel. I have MS and can't walk without help, BA did nothing, their partners Iberia did nothing. At about 3 am some kind people helped me to an more secure area and toilet and got me some sandwiches. I lost my holiday, my hotel booking, and my music course. BA insist it's not their fault it's the hotels for closing. I would not have got on the plane had I known. I found out I could go to arbitration. BA now say they will withdraw the 'offer' of expenses if I do. Their policy of refusing all compensation for what would have been a dreadful experience for any passenger, is bad enough. For someone who is not mobile, it seems to have ditched the specific responsibilities of Duty of Care and towards Disabled Passengers. So for people with disabilities it's just not worth the risk of travelling with BA."
231,"✅ Trip Verified |  I am a business class customer. British Airways cancelled my return flight and chose an alternative flight with 3 stops. After I complained, they changed the date. When I told them the date would not work, they attempted to charge me additional $5,000 for the change. I submitted a complaint and have not heard anything.  If you try to reach out, no chance."
232,"✅ Trip Verified |  Barbara Collins was super helpful. My boyfriend & I booked flights separately thinking we were on the same one but we found out at check in that he was on separate, slightly later one. Barbara was able to make some changes to ensure we flew together & even managed to put us sitting together! Much appreciate BA! We had a terrific flight over. Food, drinks & nibbles were great & staff were so friendly. Looking forward to returning home with BA."
233,"Not Verified |  My husband, parents who are in their 80’s and I were traveling back to NY from Naples, Italy and had a stopover at Heathrow, London. Let me just say we were not happy when we arrived late to London and missed our connecting flight back to NY. The reason writing this review is the great customer service that Kashmir Dhami gave us. She was very helpful in booking all four of us on the same flight the very next day, which was very hard to do because we all had different bookings so it just made it all so difficult, but she got it done! She is so kind and is amazing at her job."
234,"Not Verified |  On our recommendation my son and his young family (child 4 and baby 9 months) and wife, flew BA to the USA from Cape Town, leaving yesterday evening. Just got off the call with him, after their arrival at Heathrow. Shocked at what he told us re the cabin service provided (or not!!) especially as my wife and I have used them many times a year for + 20 years of business flights from RSA, this our recommendation to him to use them for his holiday. My grandson had a coughing fit, so they asked (bell push) 4 times for glass of water - all ignored. Last one was told ""wait till drinks are served!"" Then when evening meal served - no food available for the 4 year old, which was pre-ordered online, they said nothing available and when my son explained it had been pre-ordered - the cabin staff supervisors response - ""prove it Sir"", that sealed it for us, if that’s the BA response to what’s seen as cattle class - it will permeate to our normal travel class, so our next booking will be an alternate."
235,"Not Verified |  We had a nice flight. pushed-off exactly on time. Cabin crew very efficient in all things; friendly for the most part as well. Dinner (hot!) and complimentary wine served in premium economy very good. Do avoid middle seats though, even in premium economy. Only issue was with indifferent/non-helpful BA call center who refused to honor one world status to select seat choice in advance. Nice start to a 3 week trip to England."
236,"✅ Trip Verified |  Holidays ruined, 2 suitcases lost in 2 flights I travelled from London Heathrow to Amsterdam with my brother, before boarding we were told we couldn't take our cabin suitcases with us in the cabin, so they sent them to the cargo. At our arrival in Amsterdam, one of the suitcases was missing, left at London Heathrow, so we had to fill in a report in Amsterdam, this was 3 days ago and we still don't have the suitcase or any information about it. Today I travelled from Amsterdam to London City Airport, again they didn't allow me to board with my cabin suitcase, and when I arrived in London, the suitcase was missing, left in Amsterdam. 2 Suitcases, 2 different flights, they've ruined my holidays. No compensation, no dates on when will I get my property back, no information, lies and more lies.  I was told I could complain online and buy all the things I need, shoes, toiletries, clothes, and I might receive the money back in 30 days! Yes, I might."
237,✅ Trip Verified | Despite BA's promise to credit double tier points for a holiday booked on their website I have received no additional points and my four email communications (including to the Chief Executive) have remained unanswered. Do not be taken in by this marketing con - they just want you to book a holiday and then do not follow up on their promises. Some things just do not change at BA.
238,"✅ Trip Verified |  Refund process is non responsive I have been following up on my refund since October, 2021 which is 9 months now. I have contacted the customer service deck and sent mails to [email protected] several times and all they tell me is it’s been processed. British Airways customer service is bad and needs to be worked on. Till today I have not received my refund. I am just wondering what is happening!"
239,"✅ Trip Verified |  Customer service is non-existent. For over a week customer service number message said to call back in a couple weeks. Nothing we needed to accomplish could be done on BA.com I was flying to Nairobi to bring my sister back after her husband died suddenly, My sister and husband had tickets on the July 18 from Nairobi to JFK. When BA received the death certificate, they cancelled my sister's ticket, not once but twice. It took almost 5 weeks to correct this incompetence. My niece and my wife were on the phone for hours plus hold times. 8 times we were told by the web help number we would get a return call and no one ever called back. The ticket was in premium economy. When I tried to upgrade to be with my broken- hearted sister, the price was $4029.00 plus a $25.00 service fee. Where is the efficiency? Where is the empathy? Where is the decency? In addition to the stress of losing her husband, my sister had to go through totally unnecessary stress of not having a ticket until 7 days before her flight. Also when I made my reservation, i was given a price and within 10 seconds was told there was a $1400.00 increase. British Airways has taken a nosedive in my opinion. Words simply don't convey my very deep frustration and disappointment with the company"
240,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flight on A380 SFO to LHR. Smooth check in at San Francisco. Airport quiet and efficient. Dedicated BA lounge, excellent food and beverage options and attentive staff. Lounge was very crowded though. Minor departure delay and onto A380 upper deck. I prefer the club world cabin on the upper deck as it is very much quieter. Old style product but clean and well maintained. Staff offered a good level of service and reasonable meals. On time arrival, baggage quite slow. A good flight overall."
241,"✅ Trip Verified |  For this 5 hour 15 min flight, you are given a bag of potato chips, and a bottle of water. If you want to purchase more food and drink you do this via their app on your phone. Or like me you can pre-order weeks before you fly. However there is no guarantee you will get your order, mine never came, so after enquiring where the order was, they told me they had food for someone who was not on the plane, that someone was me it turned out. They also managed to lose my luggage.  I am still waiting for them to contact me regarding it. I will never use them again."
242,"✅ Trip Verified |  My wife and I booked a flight in April 2022 that included a return trip from Edinburgh thru London to Washington. When we checked in at Edinburgh Airport 3 hours ahead of time we were informed there were no more seats available on our scheduled flight. We asked how this was possible and were simply told that others had checked in on-line (which we hadn’t done).  We were instructed to come back in 2 hrs and 15 mins, still with our luggage unchecked and not yet going thru security, to see if we could get on the flight via standby. We waited and then finally at 1:15 PM, 45 mins before our scheduled 2:00 PM flight, we were told we could be on the flight and were given boarding passes for the flight to London but no boarding passes for the connecting flight (1:55 mins after arrival time). Our luggage was not checked thru to Washington but only to London. We were told we’d get thru security on time to make the flight and it was suggested that staff would assist us. When we got to Security Check area the line was massively long. We questioned a BA staff member who said we had to get in line like the others. We decided to pay (12 pounds) to go through “Fast Track” Security to make our Flight. We got to the gate in time. Yet, due to a delayed departure caused in part by luggage-space issues on the plane, our flight arrived in London 45 mns late, and after going to the “flight connections” we were told 25 mins before the scheduled departure, with a vague explanation of “there isn’t enough time,” that we could not be given a boarding pass for our flight. We were then directed to baggage claim to retrieve our luggage and then proceed to the check-in area to be rebooked for a later flight. When we got to the check-in counter area a BA staff person, standing at entrance to the check-in line, advised us we should try to call our travel agency to rebook because the line for checking in had not hardly moved in 3 hrs. When we finally got thru on the phone, we were informed that the best BA could do for us was to get us on a flight 5 days later, and then not to our original destination (IAD), but to Baltimore. I was not told or assured I’d be compensated for this extreme expense of staying 5 more days in a hotel - just that I could go to the BA website and make a claim on-line. This ugly experience, still ongoing, has ruined our trip to the UK. "
243,"Not Verified |  Decent flight and airplane, non existing customer service for refunds and support after delayed flight. Flight on 18th June-2022 from Vancouver to London airport was delayed for roughly 4 hours. We received a 10 CAD voucher for some drinks, this was appreciated. Because of this delay we missed our connecting flight to Amsterdam (from London), within the airplane we have been informed to go towards the British airway information desk to reschedule another flight towards Amsterdam. When we left the airplane in London, there where 3 employees working and a 400 people waiting line. We asked around towards the nice employees British airways have and we have been told this was the only line/desks to get a reschedule for our flight to Amsterdam, so we had to wait and be patient. After 4 hours of waiting and being roughly halfway the line we felt like uninformed cattle in an 4h waiting line with only candy bars and sugar cookies to eat.  At some point after 4 hours they were giving away hotel vouchers and shuttle bus vouchers because we couldn’t sleep/stay at the airport, as we noticed on the website we have been assigned another flight. This flight was about to leave Tuesday morning (it was Sunday 5pm when we arrived in London). This meant we have to spent 2 additional days in London before we were able to fly to the Netherlands. We have been told by the employees we could arrange our own transfer back to the Netherlands and save the receipts, and we will get a refund on the costs (hotel, food, transport) and a refund on the flight for Tuesday as we where not going to take this flight. They released out baggage, gave us a hotel voucher and cancelled the Tuesday flight they gave us. We were going to make our own travel back to the Netherlands. Seems British Airways claims & refund process is non responsive, as we already requested information 2 times for our compensation, but received nothing yet. apart from an automated email saying we could get a small refund based on our missed flight. "
244,Not Verified |  Reasonably smooth boarding. Meal service was smooth ad efficient but no ice or spirits available as no room on the trolley - could they have offered to serve this afterwards? Seat was very uncomfortable indeed on this aircraft so got little if any sleep on the long overnight flight. Cabin crew spent much of the time between meals talking loudly at the rear galley meaning we couldn't sleep even if the seats were comfortable. This was so disrespectful and inconsiderate.
245,"✅ Trip Verified |  Three flights, London to Reykjavik return and Frankfurt to London. Generally the flights were of an acceptable standard, though the seats and legroom are quite tight for a three-hour flight. The cabin crews were efficient and generally friendly. A big plus for BA was informative announcements from the cockpit, often missing on other airlines. Flights operated generally close to the advertised times. But BA was let down by chaotic check-in and boarding procedures. In preparation for each flight the number of check-in staff was one or at most two (in Frankfurt the lone check-in agent was also checking in Business Class passengers). Why are Economy class passengers boarded from the front and not from the back? This was standard across the three flights, but slowed down the boarding process immensely as people seated further back tried to get past forward seated passengers stowing their (enormous) cabin baggage. It would make much more sense to board people at the back first. And to enforce baggage rules so that cabin crew are not wandering up and down the cabin trying to find overhead space for the hapless passengers who boarded last. The small bottle of water and a half-full bag of crisps offered as a snack on a three-hour flight to Iceland was just tokenism and compared badly with what Air France offered on a subsequent short flight to Paris. At Reykjavik there was no departure lounge next to the gate -- passengers had to queue wherever they could in the corridor."
246,✅ Trip Verified | Routine typical BA domestic shuttle flight. Nothing special. Departure five minutes early but no one to greet flight upon arrival hence a 30 minute delay. Crew were attentive and charming. Usual clean cut BA product that when it works well is fine.
247,"✅ Trip Verified |  Over 1 week ago I cancelled 2 Club Europe flights due to testing positive for Covid the day before. They were booked many months ago and eligible for the Travel Voucher, so I opted for this online. Since then, absolute silence and BA pages state it might take up to a week (previous vouchers have been received within a few hours of cancellation). As a very loyal BA customer for more than 40 years, I am appalled at the absolute state of chaos that the airline now portrays. With a further 6 bookings with BA planned for the rest of 2022, I have to admit that travelling with them (ex LHR) has now become an absolute nightmare."
248,Not Verified |  Flight delayed slightly due to luggage conveyor breaking down. Luggage never made it to Toronto and we filed a lost baggage report. Within 24 hours our luggage arrived in Toronto and a wonderful BA representative went down into the baggage loading area to retrieve it for me. Would definitely give BA a 5 star rating and have them again.
249,"✅ Trip Verified |  Check in and security at LHR efficient. Went to Galleries North which was busy but fine with good service. Left from B gates. Efficient boarding with welcome drinks and menus. This was my first time on the club suite. Travelling with 2 children. BA moved our seated but we were all seated near to each other and they apologised for this at check in. It was a full flight in all cabins so staff busy. I liked the new suite which felt superior to the old club world product. The entertainment was excellent and the screen large and well positioned. The menu was quite limited but the quality was reasonable. Prior to COVID one could pre order mains in club which might be worth bringing back. As it happened we all ordered and were able to have the beef dish but I doubt my children would have liked the vegetarian korma had they run out. The club kitchen ran out of food quite quickly. It was a long flight so this was not surprising but my children were quite hungry as a result. Part of this was the result of other passengers from other cabins taking food from it. The second meal was fine and the cabin service director did source an alternative meal for my children from economy which I thought was quite good. On time arrival, prompt disembarkation and bags off quickly. We don’t tend to have a good track record with bag delivery so this was a pleasant surprise. Overall a good flight."
250,"✅ Trip Verified | Washington to London. Our flight was unexpectedly cancelled. My husband spent hours on the phone in the middle of the night to try and rebook our flight. We were told by the customer service representative that we should just cancel our trip (after spending thousands in lodging, tickets, tours, etc). When we finally rebooked we still lost one day, one day of lodging, and tickets to a show. We tried to at least get another day on the end of our trip but no one could help us. No one cared that our family vacation was totally altered and cost us a bunch of money. We are so disappointed and angry with the customer service here!"
251,"Not Verified | Nairobi to New York via London. British Airways has given me such grief, trying to cancel a ticket for my uncle who passed away, they canceled a ticket instead for my newly widowed aunt after they split her booking off the original booking. It is now less than two weeks until her scheduled flight, and I have been trying to amend her booking and hours and hours I have spent on hold, or with an agent, being told that my query has been prioritized and that I will receive a call back within 48 hours. I call every 2-3 days and nothing has been done to reinstate her ticket and no agent can ever resolve the situation. I will never book with BA again. Sure, flying with them is easy, but their total lack of practical assistance has caused distress and frustration and so many hours of wasted time. And to think I spent more money on a ticket with BA than other cheaper carriers thinking it would make my life easier. BIG MISTAKE"
252,"Not Verified |  Today, my husband and a friend flew from Dublin to London City Airport. All apparently went well from check-in through the flight. After that, the ineptitude and lack of systems seemed to be in full bloom. We waited and waited for our bags to come off the baggage carriage, but neither my husband's nor mine came. I found a BA service person to ""help"" me. He told me that there were 60 bags checked and 59 on the plane.  I thought, one of our bags made it. Then, two other customers from the same flight were complaining to someone else that they, too, had not gotten their bags. So, I assumed the 59 out of 60 was some kind of interesting fiction. I was then told to file a claim on BA.com which we did. At this time, about 10 hours after our flight landed, the system says they have no idea where our bags are! Now, I've had bags not get on flights before - less and less as airlines have tracked their bags fastidiously (I usually fly United Airlines which tracks your bag at every stage of the flight with updated info - e.g., ""Your bag was loaded onto the plane""; ""Your bag is on its way to baggage claim""). BA doesn't seem to have anything like this. In this case, again, it appears BA cannot even locate the bag. I hadn't flown BA in many years and with experience I would never book them again."
253,"Not Verified |  British Airways is poorly staffed at Venice airport. No one to check in 2 flights departing within 15 minutes of each other 1.5 hours before. Huge line snaking through airport. Flight crew fine. London to Baltimore segment on an older 787, usually they are much nicer. Limited TV and movie selections, wifi did not work. Flight crew ok, food adequate."
254,"Not Verified |  I booked a flight for myself and my wife from Heathrow to Nairobi in Premium Economy using Frequent Flyer points. I then paid $205 to reserve two seats on our own, in a 2-4-2 configuration cabin, as I didn't want to sit in a row of 4 people if possible. A few weeks before our flight BA emailed me to say they had changed my seat selection. When I logged in to see my new seat selection I had been moved into a row of 4? The email also stated that if I wasn't happy with the new seat selection they had made for me, I could get a full refund of the money I had paid. I called to cancel the reservation, which they did, and I paid $200 cancelation fee and they refunded my frequent flyer miles. When I asked them to refund the fee for my seat reservation, they told me all seat reservation fees are non refundable. I read them the email they had sent me when they changed my reserved seats, but the repeated that seat reservations are always non refundable."
255,"✅ Trip Verified |  Departure was about 40 minutes late. The A350 we flew on was about eighteen months old. The seating spacing in economy class seems very tight and if the seat in front is fully tilted back, it is a real challenge to get out of the seat. The screen becomes so close to your face it becomes difficult to focus on the screen. Audio was so poor due to music drowning the conversation, I gave up trying to watch. The cabin crew seemed to really struggle with service, it felt very disorganised. Felt sorry for the cabin crew they seemed to be working hard and there seems to be a lot of up and down the aisles on this type of aircraft - felt unnatural. The overhead bins are very high and many passengers had difficulty accessing their belongings during the flight. I tried using the overhead attendant light to verify my wife's meal but no one responds - better to stop a flight attendant in the aisle. Nice aircraft for a two hour flight but no fun for close to eleven hours. I am going to explore other options before using BA again, the hassle to make contact with anybody before the flight puts you off before you even go to the airport."
256,"Not Verified |  Was going from Belfast to London but they cancelled the flight, and we didn’t even know it was cancelled. Someone behind us had to tell us. we had a connecting flight and spent a lot of money on our holiday. the refund takes ages. Overall not happy at all. "
257,"Not Verified |  Second time getting poor service from BA. 1st, unable to contact via phone, email or website. 2nd even with four business class tickets across the Atlantic, they do not allow free seat selection or check in until 24 hours prior to the flight. Do they understand what the last 24 hours of an international trip are like? By the time we confirmed our seats my wife and our kids were spread throughout the plane. Of course no-one at the airport could do anything. "
258,"Not Verified |  Booked a flight from London to Paris 2020. Trip was cancelled due to Covid lockdowns. We asked BA staff for refund, told cannot do but will issue vouchers. We stated no good for two elderly people from Australia as would not know when we can travel. Informed no other option and silly vouchers sent. Now they are running out of date and unusable! Have been asking for two years for refund! Many many emails. They keep saying we took vouchers! Had no choice. Does anyone have any other options re complaints! We would be most grateful. Really not fair to just take our money! "
259,"Not Verified |  We left MIA late due to an issue with the provisioning of the plane. We arrived late and so missed our connection at LHR to CDG. At LHR British Airways rebooked us on not 1 but 3 flights to CDG and as such said I never took the flight to CDG and then cancelled my flight back to MIA since I did not take my flight. They did credit my AVIOS for the one flight but said I never took it. Thus I had to book on another airline to return at the last moment. Trying to call BA was a nightmare on hold for over 1 hour, a total of $127 extra on my calling plan only to not be helped as the person did not know what to do so he had us contact duty office who does not handle “flight only” problems feeding us back to the number we just called and we’re unable to be helped. BA cost me $5800 overall. We have flown them for years reaching silver and gold status but never again. They under new leadership have sunk to less than a budget low cost airline in customer service while charging premium rates - don’t be fooled."
260,"Not Verified |  The flight was delayed over 6 hours and this of course caused us to missed our connection flight and change to a different route, finally I lost my luggage and no one has any information. I will never again travel with British Airways."
261,"Not Verified |  Terrible experience with British Airways! I was obligated to check-in my carry-on suitcase due to my group number, according to the girl at the front desk. Then, they could miss my two suitcases, plus the luggage of my boyfriend, who traveled with me. After 3 days, they delivered 2 of our 3 bags, and since then the promise of deliver the last one persists. Now, already 10 days passed, and still no information of where the last suitcase is. Always the promise that the bag will be delivered today, but it never happens! No respect with the customer! First and last time with British Airways for sure! I don't recommend at all!!"
262,"✅ Trip Verified |  BA cancelled my flight, I never got on it, couldn't book another and refunded about a quarter of what I spent despite their covid guarantees.  I was booked onto a flight with BA for April 29th 2022 from Hong Kong to London. They cancelled the flight so I looked at rebooking for a later date; COVID ticketing flexibility assurances? Couldn't find a flight up to and including October. So I opted for the refund thinking I'd get a full refund. I was refunded about 1/5 of what I paid. I called their service centre for an explanation as I couldn't fathom how they could cancel the flight, not have any other flights available and I didn't get a full refund. Each phone call takes about 45 minutes before you get to talk to customer service. And thats where the frustration begins. The customer service people were adamant that a full refund should be given and asked me to wait while they escalate the case. A month later and about 6 phone calls later, thats 6 hours waiting on the phone, they finally refunded me a little more - in total less than 1/4 of what I paid. It would seem to get a refund in increments I would have had to call their customer service for them to take me round in circles until I got frustrated and give up. So instead of calling I enquired about this via their website .. just for an answer as to why I wasn't getting a full refund. I didn't cancel my booking, neither was it my fault they decided to stop flight to HK. After another month of waiting ... this is the reason they gave in an email. ""Thanks for contacting us about your claim for EU compensation. We're sorry it was necessary to cancel your flight to Heathrow on 29 April 2022. Your claim's been refused because BA0032 was cancelled because of non payable commercial reason. Further to your request, I would advise to kindly get in touch with our customer support team to know the status of the refund, as the same is looked after by our support team. We take all reasonable measures to avoid disruption to a flight and we always consider if there are any other alternative solutions before we make a decision. The cancellation was out of our control and caused unforeseen disruption to our schedule. Thanks again for following this up with us. Please feel free to contact us if we can help you any further and I hope we have the chance to welcome you on board again soon. Best regards British Airways Customer Relations"". I don't know what ""non payable commercial reason"" is. I am out about 250 sterling, going to just leave it their and boycott this company."
263,"✅ Trip Verified |  Belfast to London on 20 Jun, 0650. I was informed at about 0200 flight BA1427 has been delayed to 0915, will only reach London Heathrow at 1025. I reached the airport at 0445, but BA counter was only open at 0510. At checkin counter, I approached BA ground staff for advice as I have a connecting Singapore Airlines flight at 1125 on the same day. The reply was “it is the customer’s responsibility to contact the airline, there’s nothing we can do”. I was given a card with contact info on BA customer service and sales. For the next 2 hrs in the airport, I have been trying to contact BA, but was told that hotline only operates from 0800, I have to called another number for “urgent cases”, which ever number I dial, I just couldn’t get to speak to any one till 0757. Again, I was told that there’s nothing they could do because my connecting flight is Singapore Airlines. Onboard the aircraft, when I approached for help with my luggage to be placed to the compartment, I was told that it’s the customer’s responsibility to do it on their own.  I would think twice to take BA in the future."
264,"Not Verified |  The customer service of British Airways is really bad. You can't reach any call centre agent even after waiting for 30 mins. Now, I really appreciate Emirates and Turkish Airlines after facing BA's low quality customer service. Not only the customer service but the food they offer during a long haul (LDN-JNB) is really low quality. Other airline operators which are working with Do&Co for flight catering are way better than BA. I guess BA has selected the lowest budget option from Do&Co. Overall my rating is 2/5 for BA - you can feel how stingy BA is when you fly with them. Note: Respect to their cabin crew"
265,"✅ Trip Verified | BA is still charging premium airlines fares however delivering nothing better than what a low cost offers. Seat does not recline, legroom is minimal causing anyone taller than 1.60m a torture to fly as being in a sardine can. Good old times of being a glamour flying BA has far gone. Ground force almost reduced to 0, only a very cheap pack of crispy and water. The only positive side is the cabin crew always there for you and happy, or well pretending at least. For the price they charge I advise every passenger to fly any other low cost airline as an alternative. You pay extra for absolutely nothing."
266,"✅ Trip Verified |  This a new route which BA introduced at the beginning of June after several years of Covid related delays. The business class experience was I fear typical of the nickel & dime policies introduced by the airline over the past decade. Plus - helpful and friendly FA. Minuses - The cabin was fairly cramped with six seats across. Each pod had surprisingly little room with only very limited storage space. It was hard to adjust the seat, particularly getting it to lie flat - even the FA found it difficult. The in-flight entertainment was very limited with a poor choice of films, TV programmes and music. The food choice and quality was poor - one of the three mains was unavailable and my pea and mushroom risotto was almost inedible: the cheese selection was also poor. I don't know what the business class offerings from BA's rivals flying similar routes are like, but the experience does not match up to that provided by Singapore Airlines on their flights to the Far East and Australasia."
267,"✅ Trip Verified |  As a regular BA customer on European flights, it is sad but true to note that standards continue to slip, particularly ground service at LHR and the atrocious handling of delays. Staff at the entrance to the First Wing was brusque to put it mildly, rude to be accurate. Flight boarded at 1835 for a 1900 departure. 45 mins later, 4 late customers were allowed to board, and not a single PA or apology from the flight deck or crew. The benefit of low cost airlines is they they don't hang around for latecomers, sadly BA is in a time warp over this. BA pilots used to be some of the best for updating status, but this has dropped dramatically in the last 2-3 years. The food standards and choices in the T5 First Lounge are one of the items that have been improved post Covid. Inflight service on this short 2h 40m flight was a light dinner tray, only 2 choices by row 3 - with 32 passengers in Club Europe only 4 salad options were available. No printed menu offered and the cabin staff explained he had only been given 10 menus for 32 customers. It appears there is no supply control in place at BA. Food quality was okay, but while Do&Co supply this, the Do&Co meals on Turkish Airlines remain superior to what BA manages (I flew Turkish 10 days ago). Staff service was perfunctory, but no attempt to interact with any customers in Club Europe cabin. I end where I started, BA standards continue to slip. "
268,"Not Verified |  Right now do not use British Airways. When booking, person said we would have enough time between the connection flight to final destination, but he was wrong. Flight to London was late, we auto missed our flight to Edinburgh, and had to wait 9 hours for the next flight. Coming back once again flight leaving was late, had to run to get connecting flight, then we sat on tarmac for an hour because luggage had to go on so I thought good, that is probably my luggage. Once back in Boston luggage did not show up. They said we would get it within 24 hours and we didn't, so far it will be at least 2 days."
269,"Not Verified |  I could very much understand losing my luggage for 8 days with how airports are doing. This was a risk I was well aware about when travelling to Greece for my wedding. However, in my many attempts to receive communication from this company, it has been nothing but disappointment and upset. The company at one point was picking up and immediately hanging up on my husband. The most recent time I have called them, is because I requested an agent from the luggage team give me a timeline of my bag’s location, the man on the phone verbatim stated: “and if I don’t?”. After this he proceeded to tell me my bag was in Edmonton with WestJet, and that this was “not his problem”, before saying “hold” and not taking me off hold. I did not book with WestJet/nor is this Westjet’s luggage issue (they have been amazing when I have called them and have given me the most info out of everyone). I will never use this company again nor will anyone that I am close to. This has been completely disheartening. Please please do not use this company if you would like your travel to have any chance of going smoothly or any chance of receiving adequate or even any information or communication. I have never in my life been treated like this as a customer before."
270,"✅ Trip Verified |  The A80 is a wonderful aircraft - quieter than any other aircraft I've flown. Flight was delayed arriving at Vancouver from London, which meant that departing flight from Vancouver was also delayed. Passengers waited almost 90 minutes at London Terminal 5 for baggage to arrive - excuse given by BA ground staff was that the baggage staff are ""very busy right now"" and our baggage will arrive ""soon."" Onboard amenities and services quite disappointing. Seat was reasonably spacious but did not offer sufficient back support. Meal sizes and portions considerably smaller than when I last flown with BA - a tiny ham and cheese croissant for breakfast. Cabin crew noticeably absent from cabin during flight - no offer of water, juice, or other beverages during the flight. Overall, a fairly disappointing experience with BA."
271,"✅ Trip Verified |  LHR to SFO in new Club Suite. Rather chaotic embarkation despite small number of passengers. Pushback delayed by lack of tug. Club Suite seats (2K/3K) a huge improvement over previous CW product, with excellent IFE and a good range of movies. Cabin crew attentive and efficient. Food adequate and still served on the same tray. Arrival more or less on time, but delayed by lack of marshal to guide plane to the air bridge. Long queue to get through immigration."
272,✅ Trip Verified | Covid form is broken - Called customer service twice on different times and they hung up due to being too busy to pick up the phone. 1 hour flight delay - was first in the queue and had to hand in my hand luggage due to there being not enough room which was untrue as most storage compartments where empty when I entered the plane. I explained that I really cannot afford to wait on my luggage as I have 3 hours drive left after I arrive at the airport. In short: totally not customer friendly. Will try to avoid flying next time with BA.
273,"Not Verified |  Feels like BA are putting the 'economy' back in 'premium economy'. Very pleasant, friendly and helpful cabin crew. However it was over two hours before food was served on this already-delayed 7.40pm flight. A single drink was offered in plastic cups before meal service, and with the food you were offered wine only, but the crew 'could come back later' if you wanted something else - including water! I drank wine anyway but I wouldn't leap at this offer given how long it took them to do food. I've never experienced this on other airlines' premium economy products (I flew WestJet this year and they took your drink orders just after you boarded, then brought them to you before, and then with, your meal in glassware - brilliant! Air New Zealand do glass and use your name throughout). Water eventually came round after we'd eaten. As I say, the crew was pleasant and friendly but seemed under-equipped, under-staffed or following poor procedures. Food was forgettable. In-flight entertainment was great and the screens large - unfortunately after every seatbelt light announcement the screens' brightness levels reset to their retina-searing default. Not fun on a night flight with turbulence. Loos on this Gatwick 777 were halfway down economy (which was pandemonium) or at the very back. The upside to this layout is that PE is next to the exit, so we deplaned very quickly. Check-in queue at Cancun took forever. Couldn't see or hear gate announcements so everyone crowded the gate. Grateful for priority boarding in this situation. Bags arrived OK at Gatwick, no delay. I continue to avoid BA unless using Avios for business class or where there is no alternative. BA's problems all seem so easy to fix - their cabin crew are clearly eager to help you, why aren't they equipped and given service procedures to match other airlines at this price point?"
274,"Not Verified |  Phoenix to London Heathrow and then to Hamburg. Despite a 4 hour layover in Heathrow, bags didn't make it onto the connecting flight. Once in Hamburg, there was no one at the baggage tracing desk and the number provided was a dead-end; no ability to leave a message or connect to an employee. A group of passengers all missing checked baggage waited in the airport and tried every outlet possible (check-in desk, other baggage tracing desks, calling, emails) for two hours to no avail. The solution for us was to fill out a sheet of paper with contact info and baggage description. Four days later, no information where my luggage is and no way to contact customer service. Absolutely miserable customer support. Our flights were alright but after such bad customer service we will never fly BA again."
275,"✅ Trip Verified |  Worst airline experience ever. Flew 7 people business class. Check in was a disaster. The claimed I had “exchanged” tickets. After 1.5 hours at the ticket counter we were given boarding passes. We were group 1 but the delay caused us to board much later. The connecting flight was cancelled leading to a day long layover with 4 children including an infant. The ultimate connecting flight was also 2 hours late. Then they lost our luggage, 4 days later they still don't have our luggage. Calling the helpline for lost luggage results in a 30 minute to 1 hour hold after which you are disconnected without speaking to anyone. This airline is a complete disaster, please do not fly them. "
276,✅ Trip Verified |  The crew BA656 on 6 June absolutely made this flight. Smooth journey with possibly the nicest crew I've ever had. Rebooking for September we were that impressed.
277,"✅ Trip Verified |  I travelled on the 11th April with my baby in economy class, flight BA 2260 and BA 2508. I had the pleasure of meeting Sarah air stewardess. She was absolutely amazing. I received great service from her along with other staff but more importantly she went above and beyond. It was hard enough travelling with an infant but her assistance throughout the flight was really appreciated. She repeatedly asked if I needed anything as I had Arham in my lap most of the time. She held him whilst I had a cup of tea at the front of the aircraft. We had a chat and the service was just amazing. It is something I will never forget. Thank you for being there and for all your support throughout the flight. I have worked in aviation but the job you do is remarkable and under appreciated. Hope you see this."
278,"✅ Trip Verified |  Outstanding inflight service from the crew. Friendly, professional and helpful. The very best of British. Even though the departure was delayed due to chaos among ground staff at Vancouver, it didn’t matter. The crew made the flight outstanding."
279,"✅ Trip Verified |  Recent trip to Boston, departing LHR T5. Ground staff were absolutely fantastic and made an extra effort to make sure we were prepared for all the COVID entry requirements in the US, they were really friendly and personable. Very short queues for bag drop and security, I would say it took us 20 minutes from kerbside to lounge which is fantastic considering what is going on in the UK at the moment. Boarding was very quick and efficient and was completed within 30 minutes. Seated on the last row of economy I really appreciated the low density 3-3-3 layout in economy compared to the 10 abreast seating. Myself and my colleague strategically booked the aisle seat either side of the centre and were lucky enough to have no one sat between us which really helped. Considering most of the foot space in these older seats is taken up by the IFE box it really helped and would have been significantly less comfortable had we been sat next to each other. The cabin crew were excellent, well trained and personable they were very visible throughout the flight and pro-actively offered drinks outside of meal service. Meal service was very efficient with cabin crew pro-actively removing trays from people who had finished early, something that you very rarely see in economy. The food by DO&CO was exceptional, I don't think i've eaten so much on a trans-Atlantic flight in economy. It will be interesting to compare it on the return flight when its catered by an out-station. Overall it was a great flight, helped by the additional space we had but nonetheless a good performance by BA which totally exceeded my expectations based on the reviews here and elsewhere. I would definitely consider flying with them again."
280,"Not Verified |  My son travelled alone for the first time to pursue his studies and we were very concerned about any issues he might have especially reading the reviews about the airlines.. But his flight was experience was good with no delays and reached Toronto in time. We are thankful to British Airways to provide a hassle free flight to my son, especially after the troubles the airlines have gone through due to pandemic. Unfortunately, people with good experiences do not post their reviews skewing the reviews negatively. The flight was very expensive though as we booked late, after being dumped by Air Canada / Swiss air, after they cancelled their flight at the last moment."
281,"✅ Trip Verified |  As a seasoned traveller and a loyal BA customer I am appalled at the company’s recent drop in standards. We were booked to fly from ZHR-LHR on a miles ticket in February 2022. When we arrived at check in several hours before our scheduled departure we were informed that we would have to pay for our baggage even though our ticket clearly included free checked baggage. We were held at check in for over an hour whilst the check in agent went to consult with her manager who then confirmed that we would have to pay to check in our baggage. We have no option but to pay this charge however as a result of this delay at check in arrived at the gate to find that our flight had closed. As this was the last flight of the day we were forced to find expensive overnight hotel accommodation. I tried contact BA Customer Services after this incident on numerous occasion however they didn’t bothered to respond. At the 3rd attempt, after I cc the CEO on my complaint I got a one line response saying that there was no free baggage included with our ticket. At this point I got my solicitor to write a letter and they finally agreed to refund my baggage charge. However they are refusing to compensate me for the missed flight and the considerable expenses and loss that I incurred as a result of their mistake."
282,"Not Verified |  Boarding on time, but unfortunately from ORT’s worst boarding gate, which obviously was beyond BA’s control. Crew were good but lacked the personal touch. Old style ying yang business class with total lack of storage space, and the 777 was showing it’s age. However we were told the aircraft was being taken out of service the following week to be upgraded to the new club suites. The cabin crew were good, food ok, wines a little disappointing. Overall a decent flight."
283,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flight delays can happen, but the way BA handles such incidents in just way beyond. Our flight was delayed overnight, our connecting flight was missed, the overall delay resulted in more than 48 hours. Rechecking our bags took 4 hours standing in line. A rebooking to an earlier connection was denied, be it online or at the counter. Will certainly never fly BA again and do not recommend this airline."
284,"✅ Trip Verified |  Check in easy at BGI due to us checking flightradar24 and finding the flight was delayed by nearly 2 hours, no notification from the airlines so other passengers arrived earlier. Easy boarding in sequence numbers. Seat is a joke for 8 hour flight, no leg room on isle seat of 4, the seat in front frame blocks you stretching your legs and once the passenger in front reclines its even worse. Food is mediocre with poor choice and all of the drink choices had run out before the stewardess had arrived to my seat (only choice Coca-Cola, water or red wine. The connecting flight from LHR - MAN was cancelled with no contact from the airline, I only found out trying to book a seat on the return legs, with no alternative flight provided. We had to privately book a taxi from LHR to Manchester for 4 persons as this worked out cheaper than the train. The outbound flight was also a farce, no mention of Terminal change at LHR from 5 to 3, so quick turnaround changing terminals was chaotic and stressful for older relatives travelling with us. Overall shocking from British Airways and can guarantee I will never use them again."
285,"Not Verified |  British Airways - Travel with Confidence. Probably the most unsuitable tag line, they should be ashamed. Back in October I booked a holiday to Punta Cana with BA only to have it cancelled early in 2022. Late last year I also booked Heathrow to Malaga for a family wedding in May. Guess what, a few weeks ago that also got cancelled. I had the chance to rebook with BA but with so many cancellations planned I was not willing to take the risk of not making my destination for such an important event, so applied for and received a refund. I have now also asked for my Executive Club account to be closed as I shall no longer be wasting my time booking with such a shambles of an airline. My suggestion is if you want to 'travel with confidence' choose another airline. Any airline."
286,Not Verified |  Business class seating shown as a 2x2 configuration on the website is economy style with an unsold middle seat - not much more comfortable than economy. Meal service started with three options but was down to 2 options by row 5 (out of 8 in business class) and by row 6 where we were seated only one of us had 2 options then only grilled tofu was available for the rest of business class.
287,✅ Trip Verified |  We arrived 3 and half hours before our flight the queues to BA was terrible. The airport security lines were not managed well. The gate was closing as we arrived after jogging to the gate (with asthma). It was by far the worst travelling experience i have ever had that i have experienced. All the airlines should put out a warning that you should arrive at least 4 hours before to have an enjoyable experience. Amsterdam is the worst airport I have experienced. 
288,"✅ Trip Verified |  BA says that tickets are flexible and cancellation is free within 24 hrs. That reality is an absolutely miserable alternative. 8 hours after booking, I need to change my flight. I assume I will get a refund like their site says I will - that was apparently a lie. They actually give me a voucher. To request the voucher I have to sign away that I agree to the voucher despite not knowing how much money they will refund me and I might not get it for a week.  I am panicked so I try calling them. Of course, calling them does nothing. The hotline says that they are too busy. This happens again and again. So, I give up, submit the request online despite no guarantee of amount or timing. Luckily it shows up quickly, and I rebook. Then I need to change my booking again. I go to request a voucher again. This time the voucher code doesn't work on the website when I enter it. So here I am needing to rebook with a useless voucher. Finally I call the executive class phone line (which I am not a member of) and then eventually pick up and agree to help me. They do some thing on their back end and tell me that they will send the information to their booking department who will contact me in 72 hours."
289,"Not Verified |  I have been battling a long overdue refund with BA regarding a flight originally booked in 2019... The flight was cancelled, a voucher was issued, another flight was booked using this voucher, and then again cancelled. After trying to use the voucher for a new flight, BA kept advising I couldn't as the voucher had been used. I asked them to check the status of that flight (as it never left) and the agent advised she didn't have access to that information. Two years in, I managed to speak to someone who recognised that either a voucher or refund was due and made a note on my record. I then decided to pursue a refund, as felt this would be less problematic. BA have acknowledged they owe me a refund. One phone call they said it will be with me in 18 working days. I then chased when it was long overdue. I was then told it will be with me in 21 working days. The refund never came. I try regularly to get through to Customer Service for the automated system to advise no agents are available. I have also sent two follow up messages via the case reference link they sent me, requesting an update, but with no response. Honestly feel very let down by BA who up until this, I felt were the more trustworthy and reliable airline. I suspect they will have ruined many trusted relationships with customers by now."
290,"✅ Trip Verified |  When I tried to check in, they required a certificate of insurance for Covid travel, but I did not have it, I tried for over 2 hours to get it issued, but my bank (where I had the travel insurance) the department that could issue the certificate was closed, it was 18:30. After a very long time, I got a cover letter which the bank sent to me, but then to be told I had missed the check in by 2 minutes. They would not let me board, and I missed the flight. So I contacted BA, and tried to rebook another departure flight, only to be told that because I missed my departing flight, my return flight had automatically been cancelled and this was BA policy. So then they worked out a new price to book the flights, but now the price was £3500. I originally paid £1500 for the flights. I then did a search on Google and found flights for £1100, flying out with Air Mauritius and returning with BA on the same flight I was originally supposed to return on. Unfortunately BA had made me miss 2 days of my holiday, I searched for over an hour but could not find anywhere on BA site that I needed the Insurance document. When I checked in for the Mauritius airways flight, they did not ask for the insurance document, and I had a lovely flight with no issues. Every time I fly with BA, I have a bad experience and I promise I will never fly with them again. "
291,✅ Trip Verified |  Another dreadful mediocre experience with BA to Malaga. This time boarding was by bus and to a remote stand with no Aircon. Then on flight the the Wi-Fi was erratic and guests couldn’t order food or drinks. Then the card payment system didn’t work so we gave up on ordering. Finally at Malaga we were held up and not allowed to leave the plane as the bags had to come off first in case 'we' caused the plane to go unbalanced? Really? It’s all one excuse after another with BA these days.
292,"Not Verified | Basel to Johannesburg via London. Cancelled connection flight: confusing UI, still shows cancelled booking in my bookings, never sent a confirmation email for new flights.  Cant check-in. Could check-in online or via the app. Customer service is non-existent. Busy line, after 45min still no one there to help me check in."
293,"✅ Trip Verified |  Very low standards for Club Europe: there was no cabin divider in the aircraft, so no privacy or separate cabin as would be expected, aircraft not properly cleaned in Athens (there was full rubbish bag left in the seat pocket). No in-flight information as the in flight maps have long disappeared from European routes which is a shame. Staff was attentive though and tried their best."
294,"✅ Trip Verified |  This flight was not affected by recent problems with BA and I was quite impressed by the British Airways Premium Economy product in a new Boeing 787. Overall, Premium Economy turned out to be premium and clearly a step up from Economy towards Business Class. Also, the Premium Economy product came across much better in the Boeing 787 than in the old B747 or even than in the B777. Seat was very comfortable and had nice leg room. Food, service and entertainment options were good. Clearly worth the extra money for Premium Economy."
295,"Not Verified |  British Airways continues to decline in customer service. I used to love this airline and now I have had three poor experiences back to back regarding their customer service on the phone with flight changes and vouchers. The most recent experience has cost me $3000 more than originally booked due to bad rep advice and multiple calls to the company. Even as part of the Executive Club (Silver) I continue to be left on hold for ages and in the last week have spent over 6 hours on the phone seeking support. At this rate, they have lost my trust."
296,"Not Verified |  On my flight from LAX to LHR I paid to pick my seat for my flight back to LAX. I saw the $116 come out of my account the next day. As I’m adding in my booking the day before my flight, the website tells me I no longer have a booked seat and the seat I paid for has been sold to someone else. I spent an hour trying to find a way to contact their customer service and at first was told to DM the airline on Twitter which I find extremely inappropriate but I still reached out anyway because I was unable to find another way to contact them. On Twitter, I was told they were looking for an agent to help me and they never ended up responding. They just left my message unread. After about 6 hours of waiting for a Twitter DM back I ended up being able to find a chat line on their website. While talking to the agent on the chat line she informed me that they sold my seat to another customer and that she would book me a new seat, however she was unable to tell me where the seat was or how many people were in my row. After a frustrating conversation she was able to book me my original seat. Soon after I tried to pull up my booking in the British Airways app and was unable to find it. I would enter the booking reference and the site would say it was a success and the booking would show up once I refreshed the page but it did not. I continued to try and add the booking and the app would do the same thing every time, say it was a success then never add the booking. I’m not able to find the chat line again and I will not DM a company on Twitter with my support issues again. I’m extremely frustrated."
297,"✅ Trip Verified | Amazing flight and comfortable. The premium economy seats have been upgraded with a leg rest. New aircraft. Staff very friendly and professional. The food was great, beyond expectation."
298,"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked a flight to London and paid, months in advance, to upgrade my seat to an isle side exit row (front of the cabin + more legroom). Upon check-in, my expensive upgrade had been given away to someone else, and I was left to choose a miserable middle seat near the toilet. I spent an entire afternoon calling customer service. If my call went through at all (the automated system simply hangs up when it decides they are too busy) I was placed on indefinite hold, replete with elevator music and an insincere guarantee that my call mattered. I was greeted by someone with a heavy accent, over a very low quality, hard to hear line (I am 32 and not deaf). Sometimes, they would purposely hang up before I said anything. Other times, they would purposely hang up after I stated my plight. IF I managed to persist through all of that, for hours on end, they would hang up purposely after ""needing"" to put me on hold once more to ""speak with their supervisor."" In the end, BA managed to swindle me for hundreds of dollars, and I booked with another airline on principle. "
299,"Not Verified |  We are on our way home after a 3 week holiday in the UK and have had all 4 flights with British Airways. Our 2 internal flights between London and Edinburgh were great due to the friendly staff and there were no complications, however, the 2 long haul flights have been a nightmare. Our initial flight from Cape Town to Heathrow was a full flight, the staff seemed very overwhelmed, they ran out of certain food and drinks and as we were in economy right at the back we got the ""leftovers"", my entertainment system was also not working. We are about to board the return flight from Heathrow to Cape Town and the check in process was horrific. I had booked through Expedia and somehow my return flight did not have a checked in bag allowance which I didn't realise until we checked in. I ended up having to pay an additional £85 for my bag, after being told to try do it under manage my booking on the app which was not possible and I also spent 20 minutes on hold trying to get through to the BA customer service number with no luck. We asked to speak to someone is person in terminal 5 and were told that they have no customer service desk in the main BA terminal.  Overall it took us about 2 hours to get me checked in after speaking to about 6 different staff members, none of which could help me. There was also a discrepancy with the baggage allowance as my friend I am traveling with was allowed 26kg and after paying to add my bag I was told it was overweight as I was only allowed 23kg and the bag was 24kg. Compared to having flown with other airlines I will never fly with BA again, the level of service is shocking compared to what you would expect."
300,✅ Trip Verified |  I would like to thank you for the great service. I am a handicap and my family and I were afraid of this trip because I was flying alone and had a layover in London of a few hours. I had to change terminals and everything but thanks to a great service my trip was amazing. They took great care of me and made sure I was doing well throughout the whole flight.
301,"✅ Trip Verified | I connected into Madrid on Iberia and wrote a scathing review of their awful long haul business class service. British Airways short haul business class was in a totally different class. The cabin had 10 rows of seats in BC, a record for me. The staff met us at the door in a very cheerful way and this was a sign of the highly professional way they would continue to look after us throughout the flight. The messaging from cabin crew and flight crew was excellent. The food was first class, nothing was too much for the staff. Why, oh why can two members of the same company offer such different levels of sift and hard service? My thought is that it must be ingrained in the ethics of the company. British Airways keep up the good work, (it would be better if you had proper business class seats like some of your European competitors) overall you made me feel proud to be a Brit."
302,"Not Verified |  We flew from Dubrovnik to Heathrow on the 24th April 2022. Check in was very fast and we cleared security in about 15 minute, we made our way up to the lounge which just has the basic essentials but was clean and spacious. When boarding time came we had priority boarding and was the first few to board, welcomed by the cabin crew and given wipes, once seated we left more or less on tme had the safety brief taxiing for take off. Once airborne it was soon time for the drinks and meal services, choice of 3 main meal options which was very good, served by very friendly crew, the captain kept us informed about the progress of the journey arrived at Heathrow slightly early. Overall a very pleasant trip. We will be flying again with British Airways"
303,"✅ Trip Verified |  I have always chosen to not make a big deal of the poor service, delays, dirty aircraft, over packed lounges, cabin crew etc experienced over the years but have lost all patience with this airline. Having paid almost £1K extra to change our return flight for the family, to get a flight at a specific time, BA cancelled this and placed us on another flight almost 10 hours later. There was no option to get any of the other available flights. The business class lounge at LHR was packed with hardly any space to move. The aircraft was filthy with food wrapping papers on my seat and floor. The seats were uncomfortable. Food for business class passengers included bread rolls passed in a basket. The poor level of hygiene, overcrowding, delays, cancellations makes this the worst airline I have had to endure. "
304,"✅ Trip Verified | Business lounge was closed at Pisa airport which was probably beyond the control of British Airways but as it had been closed since January the least British Airways could have done would have issued their customers who paid for this service vouchers to be used at the airport, I complained about this to BA and as compensation they said they would credit my account with 10000 Avios points which I felt was an adequate compensation and at that point felt BA had handled the situation in a prompt and professional manner. However that was seven weeks ago and no Avios points have been added to my account, I have called their call centre multiple times at one point being put on hold for an hour to put through to the right department, when the phone was answered I was told it was the wrong department and to phone a number which was read out to me which was the same number I was calling! This scenario has replayed itself probably about twenty times now, it is clear that BA have no intention of resolving this and are just making their customer go round in circles before they give up, This airline is absolutely appalling in the way it treats its customers."
305,"Not Verified |  Our Good Friday flight was delayed by 5hours, STD 12.50 ATD 18.00 TO Durban, South Africa from Johannesburg. There were no announcements made, when approached no time frame was given, they simply didn't know. An aircraft had to be towed from a hanger at Johannesburg. Crew arrived late. The aircraft was filthy. We shall never fly Comair again that includes Kulula or BA absolutely shocking service."
306,Not Verified |  We had a trip with 4 flights included. All 4 flights were delayed. The worst with 2h15min. Also one flight was cancelled and we were rebooked to a 4h earlier flight loosing 4h of our short vacation. No explanation or compensation was given for the cancelled flights or delays. I expected a lot better as I have earlier used BA with good results. This was a really bad experience and I will avoid using BA for any further travels.
307,"Not Verified |  My first time in the new Club World suite. Excellent, lots of space and privacy, very good seat. I doubt if this can be bettered. Good staff as ever. My only quibble is that the food is all served at once. BA needs to roll this out quickly!"
308,"✅ Trip Verified |  I had an Incredible rude check in staff at the British Airways counter in Nice on 16th April 2022. Zero empathy towards me a struggling customer. Second situation happened when we arrived into Nice Terminal 1 on BA0262 13 April where my luggage did not make it on the same flight as me and had to put my details down for delivery. When our luggage arrived at Nice airport the day after and received an email from the AVIA Partner lost and found (British Airways Partner) at 13:14PM informing us that our luggage has now arrived in Nice. After multiple emails back and forth with emphasis on we were strongly expressing that I did not have clothes or shoes to wear and that we only had 3 short days in Monaco, it was vital we received the luggage ASAP, the lady replied “If it is so important why don’t you come and pick it up here at the airport or send your driver to pick it up” despite the fact that a proper delivery address was supplied to them from the very beginning. This has been an appalling experience."
309,"✅ Trip Verified |  We booked a business class flight with Qantas from Melbourne to Glasgow via London. As Qantas fly to Heathrow, British Airways is their partner airline so we were automatically booked on BA from Heathrow to Glasgow. We booked this flight in October however 2 days before we were due to leave, we received an email from British Airways, advising that our flight from Heathrow to Glasgow has been cancelled. To help us out the email said, they had however booked us on another flight leaving from London City Airport, which is 26 miles from Heathrow Airport and the flight is going to Edinburgh, not Glasgow. Not sure how we were supposed to get from Glasgow, additionally it is in economy, not business class even though we had booked business class originally. We booked this as one connecting flight so British Airways know that we have just travelled 22 hours from Australia. There was no mention in the email about compensation for the change of class or additional travel costs in getting to another airport, nothing about possibly not accepting the flight given it was obviously never going to work for us and no contact details for British Airways. They also sent the email on Good Friday so even when I did eventually find a contact number, their office was closed. I have never experienced such terrible customer service with any airline I have ever flow on and I can guarantee I will never fly British Airways again. "
310,"Not Verified |  The service was very good, the cabin crew were very kind and the boarding was very quick for an aircraft of this size. The seat was comfortable for economy and because the A380 walls are still expanding outwards on the first floor, there was a lot of space. The food was good for airplane food. The only bad thing was the ife screen was quite outdated and wasn't good quality, however there was a large selection of movies and TV shows"
311,"✅ Trip Verified |  Total chaos for departures immigration at Malaga Airport. Boarding was quick, polite welcome by cabin crew. Beverage cart after take off was prompt, followed by lunch with a choice of 3 entrees. Food can best be described as wholesome, but not meeting quality levels of Air France, Swiss or Lufthansa short haul business class meals. Menu is still missing, and like many other aspects of the experience, BA cut a lot during Covid and have not reintroduced. I wouldn't mind, but on European trips in 2022, BA are charging up to 3 times the fare levels of 2019, and the overall value for money is now very poor. The WiFi did not work from start to finish of the flight. Crew said it had worked on the way out and the Captain had contacted London to get it fixed on the return. BA is becoming more and more shambolic, blaming far too much on Covid and it is time they took some responsibility for their failings.
"
312,"Not Verified |  Shout out to the help desk at Heathrow, we arrived to late to make our flight and the lady (with 32 years exp) was great, she had a tough crowd to deal with and was very kind and helpful in getting us a place to stay, food to eat and a flight home the next day."
313,"Not Verified |  I am constantly amazed how British Airways continue to get things wrong - I pretty much though they had covered all those bases and in the last 15 years living in the UK, I have watched their decline with great sadness. My flight to Paris was no exception. Not only was the flight late, overcrowded and not managed at all by disinterested staff - that we sat on the tarmac, full boarded for one hour while we waited for catering to be loaded on (front and then back) left me gobsmacked. As they barely offer any food service anyway (small packet of crisps and an even smaller bottle of water) on a 45 minute flight, I wondered why they thought it was good operational planning to delay a whole plane load of passengers so that 6 people in business class could speedily eat a poor quality meal on the flight to Paris. As it transpired I was over 90 minutes late and missed the meeting I was flying to Paris to attend. Never again."
314,"✅ Trip Verified |  The short haul flights were the best with the crew on the final leg giving the excellent service that we all hope for. We chose out flights very carefully so that we were booked on flights with the Club World Suits not the Ying Yang arrangement that they still offer. At the last minute the aircraft was changed so we had to put up with the ying yang which really should have been pensioned off ages ago! Most business class offer 4 across but this layout still squeezes in 8 across. As we only take one long haul leisure trip a year in Business Class we always lose out on the ""Points game"" but I take exception to having paid in full on a non refundable basis not to be allowed to reserve my seats. The points gained from this trip alone would have allowed us Bronze status but we were not given this status until after the trip when it is useless to us. This status would have allowed us to book the seats 7 days prior to departure, when they were still available, rather than the 24 hours when they were not available. On the long haul return flight I was unable to book a window seat but on boarding after the doors had closed there was a window seat still vacant. I asked if I could move and was told by the FA she would check. Nothing happened but after take-off a passenger was moved from economy to that seat. Judging by the interaction between them I would bet it was someone on Staff Travel. I think it disgraceful that a full fare paying passenger should be treated like this. Take-off was just after 1930 hrs but we were not offered a drinks service before supper but were told we could order a drink that would be delivered on out tray with the meal. Had we done this our meal would have been cold by the time we ate it. In summary would I ever fly with BA again? No, not if I had half a chance of going with another airline. "
315,"✅ Trip Verified |  A very comfortable (new suite) flight with great service and good food. Crew was wonderful New seat is great, except the shoulder strap is very uncomfortable. Entertainment great. Wifi was annoying, cutting off and needing constant reconnecting. Generally a positive experience."
316,"✅ Trip Verified | British Airways is the most terrible airline I’ve dealt with. They have caused our family extreme stress and disappointment - we have tried for a week now to speak to someone as we can’t make the changes online. They hang up on you every time you call them - we have been driven to despair by their treatment of their customers. You can’t check in online, the application sucks so much you’re better off trying to code your own app and it’ll probably work better, every time you try to check in you are taken to a page that says we can’t verify your documents yet the app and website say you’re verified and ready to go. You upgrade and pay for upgrade and it says it’s guaranteed and then when you go to check in which you have to go to the airport for because online won’t work, they give you a different seat than you paid for and a lower class and offer nothing in return.  I hope I never have the misfortune of getting stuck flying with British Airways ever again."
317,✅ Trip Verified |  British Airways is the most terrible airline I’ve ever dealt with. They have caused our family extreme stress and disappointment - we have tried for a week now to speak to someone as we can’t make the changes online. They hang up on you every time you call them - we have been driven to despair by their treatment of their customers. I have no choice but to cancel our chance of a life time trip we’d booked with our 2 18 year old boys as they were flying with another airline and would have been alone in Japan as BA just cancelled our trip and we cannot rebook online as the trip was booked with avios and companion vouchers.
318,"Not Verified |  BA is getting a real bashing on this forum and I thought I'd buck the trend and report a virtually flawless experience of a short hop from EDI to LCY on BA8703 this Monday. Easy check in, decent lounge experience except the very amiable staff were still forced to serve from behind barriers, very clean plane which left on time, ridiculous amount of legroom in 2D (it is a bulkhead seat but with lots more space than 1A or C), reasonable cooked breakfast served by a very attentive and capable CSM and arrived 15 mins earlier than scheduled. What's not to like, which is my overall experience with the vast majority of my BA experiences over the last 25 years. Anyway I thought it would be nice to read a positive review for once."
319,"Not Verified |  New Club Suites are amazing, the only let down is the bed is a little too firm but the pillow was the most comfortable pillow I have ever used. Food was ok as I have had better on BA in the past and I can understand why they put everything on a single tray which is OK. The cabin crew were brilliant but I was surprised that after dinner the crew didn’t once come round with beverages or even bottled water. BA really have a great hard product here and I would suspect the soft product will improve once Covid restrictions become less of an issue. Well done BA."
320,✅ Trip Verified | Very small plane for a busy route. Service was good but food not so. Ran out of a lot and options left were not good. Cabin crew for BA actually really friendly.
321,"✅ Trip Verified |  BA continue to charge a premium for the most disgusting service, provided by people who shouldn't be in customer service, on tired, dirty and cramped aircraft. Out of 11 flights this year, not one has managed to depart or arrive at their destinations on-time. Including having 3 business class tickets cancelled and an alternative in economy being offered, still no refunds 3 months on and had a flight late and missed connection, so BA cancelled the rest of my ticket, leaving me stranded in the US. "
322,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew back on BA0254 Bridgetown to Heathrow in the old Club Class. A huge disappointment after going out in the new Club Class suites - the end of this awful yin and yang seating can't come soon enough. Even tried to pay BA's extortionate pre-booking rate for our seats - none left to choose even weeks ahead. My wife and I were stuck in the middle 2 seats of 4 - 13E and F. Good job it was an overnighter so we managed to sleep a bit and not have to climb over our neighbours very often. The March film selection so not good. Not particularly friendly FA who insisted face masks must be worn even though BA's policy has changed regarding flying back to a non-mask wearing destination (ie. London). Sort it out BA. Took off 20 minutes late but big tailwind so more than made up the time on a relatively smooth flight. Dinner not to bad but breakfast - fairly dire. My wife's smoked salmon bagel was dreadful. As usual when BA is good, it's really good but when it's bad it's awful. I recommend hesitatingly - come on BA, be great again. We pay a lot for ""premium"" seats."
323,"Not Verified |  The worst budget airline I’ve ever used! Far worse than Ryanair and I refuse to fly with them even though they’re basically free. BA charge about 10x as much as other budgets but have the worst service. Spent an hour checking in because their outdated computers crashed. They left us sat on the plane for over 2 hours because they couldn’t connect to the internet, then left 50% of our luggage behind because they would have had to refund everyone’s flights if they waited another 10 mins for the other luggage trolleys to arrive. It took three days to return it and cost us £100s. Then on return I’ve now been sat here nearly two hours and there’s no sign of our luggage again. I don’t know how a company can be this incompetent but I’ll be pursuing for compensation. I have some free flights from Amex but I won’t be using them because it’s not worth going through this again."
324,"✅ Trip Verified | First, the actual flights are fine and the staff on all 3 flights (ZRH-LHR, GVA-LHR & LHR-ZRH), first 2 in Economy, are absolutely fine, chatty and friendly, they are a credit to the company. The infrastructure however is appalling. ZRH-LHR impossible to check-in online and just 2 staff to check-in everyone for 2 flights resulting in mislabelled luggage and an hour delay to sort this out. GVA-LHR, 2.5hrs late as no-one at LHR to tow the aircraft to the gate. LHR-ZRH, 50mins late due to slow gate staff. Even when you check-in online you have to queue at the airport to get the actual boarding pass! There are more examples, and for this reason, until they sort out their stressed ground staff, it is impossible to recommend this airline. Onboard 10/10, getting to be onboard 1/10."
325,"✅ Trip Verified |  Have not flown economy with BA for years, what a shock! Hard uncomfortable seats, small aged tv screens with limited inflight entertainment. Food and service appalling. 13hr plus flight, no socks, eye shades, ear plug amenity pack. And no antibacterial wipes offered. Wi-Fi advertised but not available on flight. Paid premium money for a budget airline, more akin to Easy Jet, RyanAir or JetStar. My last time travelling with BA after more than 18 years of flying with them. BA you really do need to buck up your service and become the flagship Service you used to be."
326,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew to Barbados 16 March on BA 255 in the new Club Class suite. A huge improvement on the old yin and yang Club Class which we unfortunately endured on the way back. Comfortable, big TV screen with high quality picture and good headphones, plenty of nooks and crannies for storing small items and very private. Nice friendly FA's (called by my name from the off) and pretty good drinks service with a good dinner served. Once again let down by a poor (at best) choice of movies on the in-flight entertainment system. Thank goodness the latest James Bond movie was showing. Took off and landed on time. Smooth flight. Only one letdown - the usual extortionate fee charged for pre-booking a seat. Come on BA, stop nickel and diming - it spoils what could be a really good Business Class product and after all we already pay quite a bit for the privilege. I recommend with the usual caveats."
327,"Not Verified |  Very poor flight from Cape Town to London. After the chaos of Cape Town Airport passenger handling with incredibly long queues to get through security and then passport control taking nearly two hours in total we arrived at the lounge somewhat frazzled and were very happy to find a quiet area with decent wine and appropriate food choices for a break before boarding the flight. Boarding went well and we were seated and offered a small half full glass of champagne. The captain made an announcement to say that we were all aboard ahead of schedule and that the flight time would be shorter than scheduled but unfortunately this would mean our arrival would be too early to land due to the 6.00 am lifting of the overnight jet ban at Heathrow so we would have to wait on the ground for perhaps half an hour or so. This was no big deal. Then the captain announced that due to IT issues at Heathrow they could get not compile necessary paperwork so we would be delayed for an indefinite period. With the delay of uncertain duration one might have hoped for a further offering of champagne or other beverage in particularly for Business Class but this was not forthcoming. In the event take off was permitted quite soon after. The crew had distributed menus but then did a PA to say that there were changes to each of the main courses. A drinks order was taken for pre dinner drinks, for main course for dinner and choice of wine with dinner. Drinks and nuts were served circa 45 minutes after take off, in my case a small measure of white wine in the bottom of a pleasant and decent sized tumbler and my husband had another half glass of champagne. Dinner arrived on a single tray with a small measure of red wine in the tumbler. The food looked bland, unappetising and tasted the more so. The cheese (two small pieces) were sitting in a greasy pool of vinegary chutney. No top up of the wine was offered (we did ask for a second glass and it was provided on a very individualised basis) and coffee was not served since we had hit some mild turbulence. The flight was some 11 hours in duration and no other snacks or beverages were offered prior to breakfast which was provided separately to each passenger as they showed signs of being awake. Breakfast was slightly more edible than dinner. Coffee or tea were offered by individual mug, orange juice was available on request. Cabin crew were largely absent from the cabin except during the meal services but it must be said that they were extremely pleasant and were suitably responsive to requests for individual items. Come on British Airways you can and need to do better than this if you are to meet customer expectations and compete with other airlines on similar routes. For the cost of a business class ticket passengers are enjoying only additional space and seat comfort (flatbed) as a benefit over an economy ticket at or below 25% of the price paid for the premium cabin. Time was when flying in Business Class was real treat, no longer is this the case."
328,"Not Verified |  Our main complaint is that the limited food served was bland, barely edible, and by far the worst we’ve ever experienced compared to other airlines used in the past. The staff were friendly enough but they were rarely seen between meals. No snacks were offered during the flight. This is so different to every other airline we have used in the past. After 14 hours of flying the breakfast offered was a tiny, cold, stale, Ham and cheese roll and a small plain yoghurt with a couple of Oreos. If ever you decide to fly with them I suggest that you bring your own food. We certainly will on our return flight but will never use British Airways again."
329,"✅ Trip Verified |  Complete and utter chaos at Heathrow, yet again. Surely the CEO, Sean Doyle, must now take responsibility and step aside for the consistent and continuous IT problems that cause flights to be cancelled and delayed. The queue for the First Wing check in at 10am today was over 1 hour, and subsequent flight to Malaga 1.5 hrs late leaving the gate. Updated about the delays 3 times, but strangely not one person apologised or said sorry - BA seems to think this is normal practice nowadays. As Emerald OneWorld, I wish there was an alternative because BA has become intolerable, and this is after flying them for 55 years since BEA/BOAC days."
330,"Not Verified |  Feb 25, 2022. We show up at the airport 3 hours early for our flight to Dublin. we waited in line for 3+ hours to just check in our luggage. After that, we learn our flight is delayed another 3+ hours. We had a connecting flight in London. When trying to go through customs they wouldn't let us through because the boarding of the plane was going to be happening in 30 minutes. They told us to wait in a customer service line that was well over an hour. We then found out we could have gone through customs because the connecting flight from London to Dublin was delayed over an hour. However, by the time we were told this information, the doors were about to close. The next available flight to Dublin was 2/27 late evening. With that being said we were forced to stay the night in London. After talking to a British Airways manager, they informed us that BA would reimburse us for any hotel, flight (to get to Dublin regardless of the airline), clothes (due to them losing our bags), excursions and transportation. Due to this issue, we had to spend multiple days shopping for clothes, lost out on days we had booked to explore the country, had to now buy an extra suitcase for the new clothes we received (went 4 days with lost bags). When we finally got home, we submitted our claims like we were told to do. Within a few days, it's declined. We have asked for a contact # just to talk to somebody, again declined. We tried to reach out via social media and we get passive-aggressive messages.  They refuse to pay me back for the new flight to get to Dublin, transportation to and from the airport in London, the hotel for London, the clothes I had to buy because they lost my bags for 4 days, and the extra luggage fee because of the extra clothes I had to buy. There is no customer support and they are impossible to get a direct response from."
331,"✅ Trip Verified |  British Airways are in the process of upgrading all its 777 fleet to the new Club Suite, but BA59 had the 16-yrs-old, packed-like-sardines Club World product. The lounge at CPT was also bursting at the seams and food orders were so behind that many passengers had left by the time their food arrived. On boarding, we were surprised to find that the menu, amenity kit and bottle of water had already been placed in the storage drawer. We suspect this is another cynical time-saving initiative on the part of BA. Frustratingly, the menu turned out to be incorrect and the replacement dishes were probably the worst we have ever encountered in any business class on any airline. The drinks run was cancelled without any warning on the spurious basis of a passenger with a nut allergy. It's hard to avoid suspicions that cabin crew were being economical with the truth. Apart from a rather turbulent ride, the flight was otherwise uneventful and arrival was slightly ahead of schedule. Baggage handling was, however, atrociously slow."
332,"✅ Trip Verified |  We flew to Funchal, Madeira yesterday. Madeira has no COVID restrictions for entry, yet BA asked us to upload our NHS vaccination passes, before we could check in online. I received an OK about an hour later, but my husband did not, so I couldn’t check in online. We arrive at Heathrow 2 hours before departure and stood in a long queue for check in. There were just 3 desks open for a queue of approx 100 travellers. Then several people went on breaks or disappeared so we were down to one desk open, with the queue barely moving. I went to complain to various BA staff, who said the manager had been told and more people were coming. One blonde lady walked around for ages, shepherding travellers into the queue, before sitting down at a desk. Another man later did likewise, making us wonder why they hadn’t simply worked at the desks from the beginning. All in all we stood in that queue for a good hour, before almost running to the security queue, which thankfully moved quickly. Then we hurriedly bought a sandwich, walked to our departure gate and stood on the bus to the plane. The whole experience was extremely stressful; and took the best part of 2 hours. We did not have time to sit down until we did so on the plane. And completely unnecessary! If we had been able to check in online, this would not have happened. My husband’s vaccination pass is fine, but not required for Madeira. I think it is a systems failure as he received an email yesterday morning saying his pass was not in order, as did I, even though I’d previously been told, I could check in online. Also unnecessary as if BA had staffed the desks properly the queue would have moved. A staff member told us BA had laid off lots of staff during lock down and was now begging them to return, but having been treated badly, they didn’t want to. The flight itself was fine, on time. We were given a bag of crisps and a bottle of water, again fine, nothing praise worthy."
333,"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely bad experience with "" British Airways."" I have two bookings with them for the past two years. both were cancelled. The first one, I understand, "" Covid-19"" unexpected. But today I got another surprise. My flight to Antalya in May 2022 was cancelled and no explanation is given. I will definitely not book ever again with them."
334,"Not Verified |  Flew BA LHR-AUS on a 787-9 on the outbound leg and then back on the A350-1000 on the return leg. Seats comfortable. Staff service on the inbound leg was disappointing. Safety briefing was missed on LHR-AUS route. LHR-AUS boarding on time, flight flew out on time, landed on time. AUS-LHR boarding one hour late, left an hour late and landed one hour late too. Food quality on both legs was not fit for human consumption. Wife ordered a veg meal which was served cold on both legs. In flight entertainment on outbound leg was bad - 2/3 screens not working. On return leg worked fine, but this is due to the A350-1000 being brand new. Good quality of sleep on both legs, which was good. Check in at LHR was flawless and without incident. Check in at AUS was rotten. We queued and were number 4 in line and waited for 1 hour for staff to check us in. What was clear is staff quality in Austin is poor, passengers did not appear to have passenger locator form(s) ready / VeriFly app ready and / or vaccine detail ready. Having looked at business and premium economy class on both legs, paying business class and premium economy did not appear worth it. Baggage was received fine at AUS and LHR - the latter took ages on return. If I had the option of another airline - I would not fly BA."
335,Not Verified |  The food was awful. An over night early morning flight started with the offer of a terrible chicken wrap thing. Terrible. Then went to a Traditional Breakfast with disgusting sausage and inedible hash brown's. Such rubbish on BA.
336,"✅ Trip Verified | I really can’t believe they have the audacity to call this First Class. The check in staff at Singapore were abrupt and unhelpful. The official BA lounge in Singapore was closed, so they’re using a cheap generic alternative, which anyone can pay twenty pounds to go in. Suffice to say it was not pleasant. Onboard was like being in the middle of a bad comedy sketch. I can not believe the two stewardess have ever had any first class training. I had to ask for slippers. The first drink took nearly an hour to arrive, despite only having 8 passengers to serve between the two of them. The poor woman sat next to me ordered a wine, which came filled to the brim. I mean it’s First Class, not a student house party. Neither had any knowledge of the wines on the menu. Most of the food was awful. My steak was dry, over cooked and tough, and whichever catering manger signed off on a canapé of soggy mushroom on top of a chunk of polenta should be sacked immediately. I will say, the cheese and port were nice. However the worst thing was the constant galley noise. There was a cart stowage immediately in front of my seat (1K) which they were in and out of all night, and appeared incapable of shutting without slamming. They also seemed to have stored their personal belongings in to the bin immediately above my seat, so we’re in and out of that as well. I will say the seat itself is very well designed, but personally I’m happy in Club and would never do First again."
337,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Dubai. Family of 6 kids where from 10 down to 6 years old, savvy travelers, been on many holidays so we were excited to be on BA for first time. But disappointment became desperation as we had not eaten anything since Dublin that morning at 7am. We had no time to eat at LHR so thought we'll get something usually around 1 hour into the flight. 3.5 hours after take off they served out food. Food was fine but nothing special, no issues with beverage, no attention to kids as you'd expect from many other airlines, even a kids book would be good. Movies are all outdated and already watched. So overall very medium experience."
338,"✅ Trip Verified | One would think that the number of crises BA incurs they would have had emergency planning down to a fine art. I last flew with BA May 2017 - yes, the weekend of the last but one IT crisis. I swore never again but ended up purchasing a ticket Aug 2018 to Bologna - BA cancelled the flight. Then covid hit so ended up with a voucher. Fast forward to Feb 26th, 2022. Received a message 5.30am 30mins from LHR that that my flight was cancelled. Arrived at the airport with everyone else just wandering and seeking answers. The staff that were there either told you to go online - a bit difficult as the BA systems were down or ring BA. Ha Ha or go home - not very helpful if you live two hours from LHR. By some miracle the app sprung into life, and I managed to get one of the last 10 seats on the evening flight. Sat in arrivals as there was a coffee shop - soon ran out of seats. By 12.00 midday most of us were trying to get airside to use lounges but no one was allowed in departures until two hours prior to your flight supposedly because of crowds. Pointed out BA should have provided refreshments - told to put a claim in. Eventually got to departures and made it through security. BA customer services (note the oxymoron) - had a consistent queue of about 20 people as BA were still cancelling/rearranging flights for passengers who were airside. Boarded flight 45mins late. Sat on tarmac as the pilot told us the delay was them trying to 'reconcile' luggage. When we took off given one very small bottle of water and a cereal bar for a five-hour flight They purport to be a top-class airline but in fact Ryanair has more finesse. The staff are fine but can be miserable because they are treated so badly and like to remind you that they are doing their best in a difficult situation - well so are the passengers. The aircraft are cramped and worn. I had been reluctant to use Egyptair but flew home with them on a new aircraft with a very good entertainment system and was provided with a hot meal and snack for same price as a BA ticket. How on earth can BA justify their prices? The management should be sacked as ultimately they are to blame for the ruination of this airline."
339,"Not Verified |  We will never use BA again for a long haul flight. Our experience of the flight from LHR-MLE wasn’t too bad, apart from a screaming child but the return wasn’t a good experience. We weren’t provided with a drink when we boarded as we were forgotten and that happened a few more times during the flight. I think the crew in Premium Economy were very young and not very experienced, leaving the experienced ones in Business/First. Actually, I think BA only care about the Business/First customers now with the cabins getting larger for those classes. They ran out of food choice 8 rows back in our cabin (it’s not a large cabin), ran out of wine straight after the food service and we had no food for 7hrs apart from a couple of biscuits, one of those we had to go and get from the kitchen. We weren’t fed until 1.5hrs before we landed (it was a 11.5hr flight) and then it was a soggy roll containing 2 slices or cucumber and 2 slices of tomato! BA just don’t care anymore about the little people."
340,"✅ Trip Verified |  British Airways is getting worse an worse, my flight was 8 mins late. Luggage is taking hours to arrive.  No communication whatsoever from anyone. They can't be reached on the phone and answer with delays to emails, if they do. My app is crashing most of the times. They change the aircraft without notice, so even if you pay for a seat, the staff will say there is nothing they can do."
341,✅ Trip Verified | Paid for 3 business class seats to London from New York. Got downgraded at airport check in because they overbooked business class. Couldn’t even provide compensation or a refund. Told I had to call customer service or submit a form. Unbelievable. Unacceptable. Never again. 
342,"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely shambolic customer service. The lounges at Heathrow are outdated and the service was terrible, waited over an hour for my chosen food/drink order to be brought to me. Ended up getting it myself and told off for doing so. On board product is average. "
343,"✅ Trip Verified |  Our flight back to Athens (on a different airline) was very delayed, causing us to miss our first flight home. I understand that they were not required to help due to the delayed flight being a different airline. What's worse is that they went ahead and canceled our tickets for our connecting flight, which we would have been able to make based on another flight out we found, causing us to have to buy much more expensive tickets home that resulted in us having an overnight layover and having to buy a hotel room on top of ridiculously expensive last minute tickets. The absolute worst customer service I have ever dealt with, and I will never be flying with them again."
344,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flight took off two hours late after what can only be described as a shambles at the airport. No airbridge to the aircraft which is not acceptable. The aircraft was better than the outbound flight, who screen was so small. After serving only about 2/3rd of the cabin, no first choice. Only a vegetarian dish or a chicken dish from the economy cabin. The airline must know that vegetarians will order a meal, so why include it as a choice. Also, to offer a roll of ham/cheese for breakfast after a 12 hour flight is cost saving. A hot breakfast should be offered. With only 90 minutes between my connecting flight, due to late arrival, I made staff aware. Whilst they let me and others passengers of the flight first, there was no staff to assist in getting us to our flight. It was a struggle to get my connecting flight. On arriving in Glasgow, got txt to say my bags did not make the flight. First time using BA premium and likely my last."
345,"✅ Trip Verified |  There was a mistake on my booking made by BA. Got an email to say ""contact us to discuss"". Took over 30 contact attempts spanning 7 hours and still not resolved. Absolutely the most shambolic customer support I have ever experienced. Still waiting for the call back I was promised 2 weeks ago."
346,"✅ Trip Verified | The economy cabin was surprisingly underpopulated on this flight, with only about 30 passengers, but business class was three-quarters full. Boarding was therefore mercifully quick and take-off on schedule. Sadly, BA59 makes use of the old Club World product, which now seems like a step back in time after experiencing the new Club Suite on BA42/43. There are some good points about the old Club World - the drawer capable of taking a laptop and the more comfortable seat when flat - but other than those, it's an embarrassment. The tiny, poorly responsive screen is almost beyond belief. Service was perfunctory and the meal service conformed to the current, overly cautious, post-Covid requirements, with everything served at the same time. This does mean that the meal is over and done with relatively speedily, but it's a lacklustre experience in contrast to BA's competitors and smacks of continued cost-cutting. Queues for the three toilets in business class were unacceptable at times and there was limited attention paid to keeping them clean. Arrival was on schedule, but Covid paperwork processing meant that it was an hour before we were able to collect our baggage."
347,"✅ Trip Verified |  British Airways continues to go downhill. We flew business class and the experience was like economy from 20 years ago except you can have a glass of champagne. We were packed in full 3x3 seats because of IT issue the day before. Even if weren’t, the Seat pitch and width is the same as economy. Gone are the little pretend tables in the middle seat to give some illusion of style. The food was dreadful. The in flight service was unsophisticated. BA used to have an acceptable European business class. They don’t any more. Other European airlines offer much better in flight experience in business class in comparison. BA is taking premium and frequent flyers for granted and treating us like mugs. How I miss the politeness of old BA business class from around 5 years ago, how I used to look forward to it, the small gestures like hanging up a coat, giving you a hot towel, having nice food, being served from the galley, rather than from the manky trolley. COVID is not the reason - this is years of cost cutting and the result is dreadful."
348,"✅ Trip Verified |  Outstanding! From the warm, smiling welcome on board, this flight was excellent. The in flight crew were friendly, attentive and very professional. Detailed announcements from the flight deck as well. Food and wine all very good indeed. The Premium Economy product on BA is also very good. Comfortable seats, foot and leg rests and decent recline. FR superior to any other airline on other Atlantic routes."
349,"✅ Trip Verified |  British Airways has scrapped the mandatory wearing of face masks onboard flights, although they pretend publicly that the policy remains. BA454 from London to Malaga on 25th February, and across 6 visible rows around me there were 7 out of 24 passengers wearing face masks - and I was one of them. This was long after the meal / drinks service had been cleared, and remained like that as we landed and deplaned. Cabin crew were frequently up and down the aisles and not a word was said to any of these non compliant passengers, or as they left the aircraft with staff bidding them farewell. I guess they are too scared to remind people to follow the rules? "
350,"✅ Trip Verified |  For once more BA got it all wrong with 6 hours delay, food voucher of 4 pounds and no information or advice. No staff to serve the waiting passengers. The attitude towards the passenger is one of a dispensable commodity."
351,Not Verified |  Another episode of unmitigated shambles when it comes to customer service. The day after Storm Eunice and English half term holidays are getting underway. So you make allowances and you accept there could be some delays. The fact they were then compounded by the late cancellation of a raft of flights to domestic and European destinations on the evening of Saturday 19 February for operational reasons was pitiful. You could not rebook via BA’s website. Instead passengers were compelled to queue at Gate A17 at LHR to possibly rebook and be provided with accommodation overnight. Some BA cabin crew were helpful but those in customer services in the South Lounge who simply directed passengers to the ever growing queues at A17 were a disgrace.
352,✅ Trip Verified |  Check in at IAD was quick and easy. Lounge in Washington was a BA lounge and very good. Sound pre flight food offerings for this overnight flight. Flight on time and boarded promptly. As we had eaten we opted to sleep. There was full dinner and breakfast service for those that wanted it. We slept well. On time arrival and quickly made it to T5 arrivals lounge which was excellent.
353,"✅ Trip Verified |  Very old planes, poor food and minimal leg room in economy. Check in procedure online did not work for me or any of my fellow travellers. Special meal request given weeks in advance for food allergy was ignored. I spoke to a BA customer service representative as soon as I landed in Heathrow who said they could not help and referred to the telephone line who said the same but referred to the online complaints form. Have been trying for weeks to raise this as a concern for those with food allergies and prevent this from happening to others but no reply via their complaints website or on Twitter. Telephone hotline is now also currently unavailable."
354,Not Verified | Having just booked BA for a return flight - being one hour each way in Club Class and paying + 700 euro for 2 persons to be then asked to pay a further 96 euro to choose seats in business. A full business class ticket and a fee for seat? A very disengaged management model.
355,"✅ Trip Verified |  BA got everything right. Allowed evening before check in , this allowed lots of time for staff to help with paperwork needed for travel to the US. On the day of travel it was half term and the Airport busy. In spite of this through security and into lounge in 5 minutes. Lounge clean, staff proactive and food served quickly. Good range of drinks. Easy transfer to C gates. Aircraft ready, boarding quick and well organised. Pre departure drinks served. The cabin crew were excellent and provided a very good service. The food was the new club world menu options ( roast beef) which was excellent. Although it was the older club world product it was clean and well maintained. On time arrival, baggage off very fast. Overall an excellent flight and it feels like BA are improving their offering at a time when many other providers use COVID as an excuse for service cut backs Well done"
356,✅ Trip Verified |  Appalling customer service - they have cancelled flights and rebooked us but have not confirmed any change to the hotel reservation that was part of the inclusive booking. Hours and hours on the telephone with no response (or you just get a recorded message to say they can't take the call). They don't respond to emails sent to the complaints line. 
357,"✅ Trip Verified |  This past November/December I flew Washington-London return and, on the strength of that trip (my first in two years), the inflight service quality appears to have pretty much returned to the pre-pandemic status quo ante. The cabin was clean and well maintained, seats were comfortable, food and drinks were good (including a very tasty Hertfordshire roast pork on the return leg), and the BA cabin crews remain the best in the business. This was one of a number of bookings that I had to re-book a number of times due to flight cancellations, and contrary to the experience of many here, my re-bookings were handled courteously and thoroughly (although I did have a number of lengthy waits on hold, but under the present circumstances that's to be expected). It's good to see that the everyday product has held up so well amid this dreadful time, and I'm looking forward to future trips on BA."
358,"✅ Trip Verified |  I had the best experience I have ever had with an airline. Our initial flight to Dubai was canceled By Royal air Maroc and we had to find a new flight at the last minute. I found that booking with them was extremely simple. Unfortunately, we had to cancel our flight the day of the departure. I called the customer service, waited about 20 minutes before I could speak with someone and within 15 minutes, the flight was canceled and they offered me a full refund. The person on the line was extremely nice, understanding and willing to help us. I had never dealt with such a nice employee from any airline. I got the full refund on my credit card the day after. I usually chose the cheapest flight ticket, regardless of the airline, but from now on, I’ll definitely make sure to check with British airways first."
359,"Not Verified | BA cancelled our original return flight and rebooked us a day later. We had no issue with this, just enjoyed an extra days holiday but others might not have been so flexible. However, they overlooked rebooking our connecting flight from LHR and we were fortunate that there was still space on the flight when we checked in at ATL. The aircraft was newish and in excellent condition, flight was around 50% capacity. Service was excellent, staff were friendly and efficient. Dinner was good, breakfast was disappointing with little choice. The LHR to BHD leg was equally good and I am beginning to think that BA are getting their mojo back again."
360,"✅ Trip Verified | Boarding was slow and uncomfortable on account of the lack air-con at the gate. The Club Suite cabins were about 3/4 full, but the rest of the plane can't have been much more than 20% occupancy. Whether this is the reason why cabin crew on the flight were cut to the bare minimum is hard to say, but they certainly had to work hard covering multiple cabins. Despite that, the drink and food service in business was efficient, and the current policy of serving all courses at once meant that dinner was done and dusted two hours after take-off, which is a real bonus on a night-time flight. However, the quality of the food remains mediocre at best and the pasta dish was almost inedible. The Club Suite is a big improvement on the ancient CW product, although storage is a funny arrangement of tiny compartments that invite losing a smartphone or two. One definitely misses the drawer at foot level in old CW. The large screen really improves the viewing experience and the whole IFE system was much more responsive. The new seats don't significantly aid sleeping, particularly as there's an obvious ridge at the level of the base of the spine. Waking up two hours before touchdown is definitely to be recommended in order to get breakfast over and to avoid the usual queues for the toilets. Performance of the flight deck was up to its usual high standard and arrival was twenty minutes ahead of schedule. Progress through border control was speedy but baggage collection was delayed for unspecified reasons. Overall, a good flight."
361,"✅ Trip Verified |  Unfortunately having just flown in the new club world cabin this time we had an incredibly old plane. The good was the cabin crew who tried to make the trip as pleasant as possible. The bad was the in-flight entertainment, the screens were unwatchable when they worked, my wife’s didn’t, and post iPad era just don’t live up. The food was just about okay without being anything special but all served at once. Apparently the crew explained this is because of a shortage of staff. I’m afraid BA has a lot to do to regain its standing in the aviation world, the competition is too fierce now to sit on your laurels."
362,"Not Verified |  Utterly appalling company. We've flown with them two times now, and both times it's been a disaster. The first time: Return flight was delayed by over 24 hours. There was nobody at the gate to tell us this, so a large group of passengers had to roam round Dubai airport looking for BA staff. There were none. Eventually another airline told us to go down some unmarked stairs, where a very angry person told us it was our fault, and we should have been given a letter. We had no letter. They then put us on a bus to the other terminal. When we arrived, there was nobody to greet us. We were literally just left there. We had to, yet again, contact another airline, who managed to find us transport to the hotel. When we got there, we were told it was full and we couldn't choose our rooms. We were given a terrible, dirty, cramped room. Several times throughout the night we were called to tell us our flight had been moved. Eventually we got to board the next day. My tray table was broken, as was the window blind, and I didn't get a meal. No compensation was offered. The second time I need to reschedule my flight. The website assured me this was fine, but provided no link. I needed to phone up. If you need to phone BA, don't even bother trying. I never got to speak to anyone, and just ended up booking a hotel to wait for my flight rather than rescheduling. The food has been terrible, meagre portions given infrequently. My sandwich was inedible. 
"
363,Not Verified | Over the past 2 years I have flown with British Airways twice and ended up in the exact same predicament of having to wait around all day in London Heathrow for a 1 hour flight home to Newcastle. While the holidays and the plane staff are fantastic the customer service and the staff at Heathrow are useless. First time in February 2020 I got stuck in Heathrow due to Storm Ciara when travelling home from work which was not the airlines fault. However the handling of the situation by the staff at the airport was a joke. They had 4 to 5 staff ran a kiosk queue of over 100+ unhappy travellers whilst they could have set up mini kiosks on the unused gates to get through everyone quicker. Their was no crowd control and at one point after queuing for 2 hours plus the staff decided to shut up shop. In the end after a 12 hour battle I was lucky enough to get home on the last flight of the day through sheer luck when I finally spoke to someone. In November 2021 I decided to give BA a second chance and booked to go to New York. Since the plane landed late into LHR I missed my connecting flight which could have been avoided if the staff at Heathrow had assisted me or held the plane for a short while. As I rushed through customs I did manage to make it to the gate with 5 minutes to spare and the plane still in the terminal but since they had taken my luggage off the flight they told me to go to the service desk and refused to let me on since they had moved me on to a later flight. My layover was now 10 hours and all I got from the guest services was a £12 food voucher to spend and a phone number for what I thought was complaints but after being on hold for 20 minutes found out it was not from complaints. Considering the fact this could have all been avoidable with more assistance to have only been given a food voucher for £12 seemed really cheap. A few days after I got home I then raised a complaint expressing how annoyed I was and waited over a month for a response before chasing it up only to find the complaints staff were not working. When I got a response I said I wanted 20-25% back off my holiday. I got an apology and told the staff at Heathrow will be better but in terms of good will and compensation I was offered nothing! 
364,"✅ Trip Verified |  Return trip Cape Town to Durban in Club Class highlighted the inconsistency. Our outbound trip in December was good in all respects, whereas the return trip was disappointing. Check in was fine, apart from the agent failing to label one of bags priority, resulting in a long wait for our third bag. The lounge was busy, but no complaints. We went to the boarding gate at the check in time indicated on the screen, where there was no sign of activity, although the screen was still showing the same gate and departure time. Shortly thereafter two ground staff appeared and when approached said the flight was delayed from 1330 to 1410 and the gate was changed to the lower level bus gates. The informational screens had now updated to the delayed time and new gate. I checked on the flight radar app, which showed that our aircraft had started in Durban, and flown to Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, back to Cape Town, and it had been clear for some time that it had no hope of being on time for our flight. In fact looking at its schedule and turn around times it was always going to be late. Boarding eventually started at 1400 with departure at 1430, 60 minutes late. Drinks service only started 30 minutes later, followed by lunch. The food was good but the wine offering very mediocre, and not up to club standards. With the price of good wines in South Africa there is no excuse for serving poor wine. Lunch service was quick, but then the crew disappeared behind the curtain and there was no offering of top up drinks unless specifically requested. Overall this was a disappointing flight with a lacklustre crew"
365,"✅ Trip Verified |  I used British Airways for the first time and I have to admit that I am impressed with their service! Firstly, I want to thank the lady that assisted me to weigh my luggage. My flight was 16:10, however due to unforeseen circumstances, I arrived at the airport around 15:40. I was convinced that I was going to miss my flight because the queue was very long. I stood there a few minutes but then realized that I would miss my flight. I went to ""Club check-in"" and the lady was incredibly kind to me. I just cannot believe how patience she was with me even though I was at fault. She weighed my luggage and I was able to board the flight successfully. I was not aware that this airline gives out free meals. We got a sandwich and drink and we had an option to choose between vegetarian and chicken. I personally love free stuff so I will be ditching Flysafair (even though they have excellent service as well) in the near future, unfortunately. Diversity; The first time I flew was in 2018 and I have to admit that I have never seen such diversity amongst cabin crew staff however with British Airways it was different.  The staff was very kind and friendly as well. What a wonderful experience to fly with these guys!"
366,"✅ Trip Verified |  I recently had the unfortunate privilege of travelling on British Airways from Detroit to Bangalore and back. Given that it is a long and arduous journey with multiple layovers, I decided to spend extra and get a business class ticket. I was quickly dissuaded of any misconception that I was special because I spent that extra money or was in Business class. From shoddy service to rudeness and insolence from ground staff, I experienced nothing but frustration and insecurity throughout my journeys. The trump was being stranded in London having missed my connection and spending close to 3 hours to get to the front of the counter to rebook my flight. Being a business class traveller had no bearing as we were all told to stand in one gigantic line and wait our turn. Some special passengers were escorted to the Club World check in. When we asked the lady, she told us to continue standing where we were and she would come back to get us when the counter freed up. Needless to say it never did. Finally got my turn with no extra help from any of the ground staff that was running around in a frenzy and was rebooked. So I come back to the question: Can big corporations lie with no accountability? Why would I spend my hard-earned money on something that gave me nothing extra? Shame on you British Airways for your complete disregard for your passengers. Stop your lying or update your promises!"
367,"✅ Trip Verified |  I have flown with BA for many years and today was another poor experience as I’ve witnessed the airline decline into a sub-par service. I understand that it’s been a tough two years for airlines but BA’s decline started before the pandemic and it has now truly plummeted. Enormous queues at JFK BA check-in terminal 7. Even the priority lane was at a standstill for at least half an hour before people started complaining they’d miss their flights. Terrible efficiency at the check-in counters. At times, only one member of staff is processing people whilst other BA staff stood around on their phones or having a chat. One member of staff stopped processing a man desperately trying to catch his flight in order to start processing someone else who had jumped in. The interior of the plane was generally filthy, crumbs, bits of food, stains, marks all around the seating area. They give you a single wet wipe which I used to think was for your hands but now I see most passengers wiping down their surrounding area. There are some very good and courteous members of staff but there are also some awful members of staff who behave unprofessionally. On this particular flight one of the cabin crew is as swearing about his colleague at the back of the plane who apparently wasn’t pulling his weight. Very poor. I used to be a proud BA flyer but now I just feel like I’m clinging on to my airline status which doesn’t actually provide you a better service these days."
368,"✅ Trip Verified |  The entertainment selection was sub par, minimal selections and the new releases were  not new releases. My food left something to be desired. Two of the seats in our row the earphone jack didn’t work. The plane was either uncomfortably hot or too cold, find a medium temp. Just overall a very basic generic airline."
369,"✅ Trip Verified |  Straightforward and friendly baggage drop. On to South Lounge, no polite conversation on have you used our lounge before, no indication that it was so busy there was nowhere to sit at all considering even the 1.5m distancing. Had to roam the entire lounge, lugging our bags on the carpeted floor, with no success at all. Gave up after 20 minutes and decided to try another lounge. Arrived and everything was actually right in front of us and actually found somewhere to sit after 5 minutes of looking around. Menu was basic with no eggs, hash browns or any breakfast cakes or muffins. Ordered a frittata as was so hungry. Made my way to the self-serve coffee counter which had basic coffee and was straight away put off by flies hovering over the croissants and fruit. Flight was departing from a gate where you had to take a train to and as if to rub salt in the wound were then told that DXB flight usually leaves from there and should’ve gone to the lounge near there. Looking at the individual cubicles which was to be honest our top reason for choosing business class gave me heart. However, the doors cannot close till take off. I asked for the artisan crisps or biscuits on the Menu and it took them over an hour. Lunch came in another almost hour. Asked if could swap puddings as am not a crumble person, said will surely try but clearly didn’t, with no apologies or even trying. Portions were small, plus saw quite a few fellow passengers sleeping through lunch so asked if could have more but all was finished. Chocolates are Lindor. Nothing special about the other amenities, toilets were no different to what you’d expect, amenity kit was basic, duvet seemed well used. It was not worth almost 4 times the amount of a regular ticket. Naive to trust claims of world class standards."
370,"Not Verified | On arrival at the Warsaw Airport the check in zone was the only one that was not announced on the flight board - we had to guess and ask random people where to go. Once we finally found the check-in desks, luggage drop and check-in was appalling. It took us over 1.5 hours to get our bags checked (and we were half way through the queue). The whole process was disorganised and very slow, really the last thing you want when looking after 2 small, impatient kids. Lady in Warsaw Airport who was supposed to direct passengers to the correct queue was useless. One check-in desk for Euro Traveller / Club Europe, one for bag drop and one for the check-in.  Flight left delayed but the pilots managed to catch up and landed with a small delay, crew on the plane was nice and attentive. Luckily the in air experience was much better, but sort out your ground service at Warsaw Airport."
371,"✅ Trip Verified |  In Glasgow one check in desk open. Huge queue with no business check in. It took me close to an hour to bagdrop. Getting onto the aircraft in Glasgow, no hello from the crew and the same getting off.  I normally find BA cabin crew very nice. Breakfast was a very tired looking croissant.  I used the BA lounge in Terminal 3. Not very keen on the new table service. Poor choice and miniscule portions. Lounge staff were very nice in both directions. On arrival at LHR there was a coach transfer from T5 to T3. We were packed in like sardines. So much for social distancing. The flight from LHR to Pisa was delayed and once we boarded we sat on the aircraft for another 2hrs 30 mins. Captain advised us that there was no tow truck for push back and when it did eventually arrive there were no baggage handlers to load the containers. No drinks or anything offered while we waited. Food was not even worth mentioning. As far as Club Europe goes it's not worth the extra cost. No priority baggage as mine were last onto the belt in Pisa, seats are economy seats with the centre one blocked off. The first officer summed it up when we arrived in Pisa- Sorry folks this trip was a pretty poor show by BA, and he was right. For the return trip on Hogmanay we left on time. I've never been on a flight to or from Pisa which has left in time. Pisa lounge is nice enough but the food choice is laughable. On board I gave the food a miss.  Heathrow back to Glasgow Flight left on time. Food was an antipasto of some sort which I declined.  Both cases were last off again. Club Europe is really not worth the money as you are in an economy cabin. I would have thought that BA would do more about their food and onboard service since the cabin is what it is."
372,"✅ Trip Verified | After two years of being unable to fly to our second home in South Africa because of COVID, it was fantastic to be back on board a BA flight to CPT, and in the Club Suite seats (1K and 2K) to boot. These seats are a huge improvement on the old yin-yang CW seats in terms of privacy, ease of access and the IFE screen, but the cabin still felt densely occupied and the seats were just as uncomfortable when lying flat. Storage was a mixed blessing, too, with three rather fussy little compartments rather than the decent sized drawer in the old CW, meaning that a laptop would have to be stored above. The food onboard was woeful, although serving all three courses at the same time does at least mean that the dinner service isn't dragged out. Cabin crew went about their business dutifully but with little enthusiasm, and there were the usual queues for the toilets. The flight itself was uneventful and landing was more or less on time. CPT had an efficient arrangement for checking forms immediately after leaving the airbridge and there were no queues at immigration. It was good to be back!"
373,"✅ Trip Verified |  I paid $1189 for a round trip flight to London and back in premium economy. They bumped me from the seat for the flight back, and told me I'd be issued a refund. Instead of being issued a refund I had to contact them through several different methods, phone, website, Twitter, and finally email. They told me I'd be getting $229.16 back, which is less than half of the $589 I paid for the upgrade. Instead they refunded $14.58. I emailed again and they told me I'd be getting $115.16 more back. When I emailed again saying that that doesn't add up to the original amount I was told I was getting they simply replied with ""That's the final amount."" Turns out that meant they were taking back the initial refund of $14.58 and I was only getting $115.16 total. So I emailed them again asking why they changed the amount and they've yet to respond. So I called this morning and after explaining politely what I was calling for they hung up on me."
374,"✅ Trip Verified | Very nice return flight with BA. To add to my previous review, I really like how BA organises boarding and disembarking processes in groups, this is super comfortable as 100+ passengers don’t jump out and then sweat in a queue when the gate is not even there. The A320 was new and the cabin had a fresh feeling with nice mood lighting. Row 1 has an enhanced legroom and thus, makes the 1-hour hop very comfortable. Once again, amazing staff, and they were even more attentive and accommodating to Gold level passengers: always coming and asking if any help is needed. Lovely humus, beetroot and quinoa salad for food. Great WiFi at really competitive pricing + I think it is great that they also have food / alcohol offered to buy online for all travel classes. Domestic T5 arrivals is a breeze."
375,"✅ Trip Verified |  Overall, a very lovely flight with BA to Edinburgh during Christmas holidays. Lounge was ok, quite worn out, although staff and food were nice (much better than when I travelled last time). Although the plane seemed old, the cabin felt very fresh, clean, temperature perfectly adjusted to my liking (around 22-23C) and Had a funky lighting. Although seats are the same as those in Economy, they are pretty comfortable for a 1-hour hop (much better than those at Air France) and together with an enhanced legroom in row 1 it was wonderful (for Gold card passengers, BA automatically reserves row 1 in Club Europe with enhanced legroom which I think is a great touch). The crew (especially the purser) were phenomenal: extremely friendly, adaptive to your needs and professional, leaving a very pleasant flight aftertaste. Afternoon tea catering was lovely for this short flight: sandwiches and scones were tasty. I am actually a fan of well-presented, however simpler meals on board; to my opinion, they are just tastier and give a feeling of trust. For a quick hop, BA ticked all the marks here (in comparison, on a CDG-LHR leg Air France presented a ‘chic’ cold starter, however, to me, it looked a bit too complicated and, except from the duck terrine, rather unappetising / KLM served a super nice and simple Chicken Caesar but it was in a paper box). One big drawback was the First wing experience at T5: the queue there was so long that I decided to go through the regular lines instead. It’s quite disappointing given how much money regular flyers / their companies spend to earn a Gold status. Nevertheless, the flight and, most importantly, the crew completely negated that drawback. The flight was £200 one way (£600 return incl. transfer to Kirkwall) which was pretty expensive, however, the service seemed like it was worth the money."
376,"Not Verified |  First of this was one of the smoothest UK to US flights I have taken. The boarding was appalling and had families with kids queue for no reason at all. They called families to the front but then decided to board business and premier classes first which I appreciate why but why call families? The worse seats ever and the legroom was appalling. The entertainment system is basic, it does not support Bluetooth headphones, the USB does not support your own devices for movies although the website says yes and the headphones input was as good as useless.  The crew were nice so sorry I missed that."
377,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flying during covid is always a challenge. BA’s VeriFLY app worked perfectly and on-line check-in was seamless. The bags drop at T5 was seamless and boarding was done efficiently by zones. Although an older 777 it had been refurbished and everything was new and clean. The cabin crew were a credit to the airline – smartly dressed, friendly and keen to please. We were offered two drinks before lunch was served, with more drinks with the meal. The food was acceptable and we were given a tasty sandwich before landing. Obviously it was only economy but, after 8 hours flying, I arrived relaxed and unstressed."
378,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew to Nashville via Chicago in first. Excellent check in and security. Lounge was good. Food and drink choices very good. First cabin on 787 is 8 seats. Comfortable seat, entertainment a little clunky. Cabin service top banana!! Food and drinks choices and tastes amazing for an aircraft. A special call out to Stewart Tim. A credit to BA."
379,"✅ Trip Verified |  I had low expectations of business class BA on European routes but this flight was even worse. T5 is a mess with 90 minute queue to check bags with tons of people arriving late. Check in guy seemed clueless about Turkey needs for pcr etc. BA lounge is a joke so i went out and got sushi from a restaurant - there was mulled wine in crowded lounge but just bad all round. Boarding was chaos and we left an hour late. A320 was jammed full but business class there is little legroom and just the middle seat free, you might as well fly a low cost carrier for same seat. There is no inflight screen no overhead screen. Although the curtain was closed economy people used the forward bathroom with no crew sending them back. The only salvation was a pretty decent shepherds pie and red wine otherwise I would avoid flying BA. The next day I flew the same aircraft type to Bahrain on another carrier with proper business class seat in flight screen, headphones, good food and drinks, Arabic coffee, dates and gracious service. BA hang your head in shame."
380,"✅ Trip Verified |  We've just used the new Club World for the first time and were delighted with the new configuration. The privacy afforded is so much better, in-flight entertainment and storage were brilliant. Unfortunately, we had the most lethargic crew ever who once the meal was served basically disappeared. The wines were warm, they even forgot to offer my wife a drink with lunch, and she also had a pair of used socks in her storage cabinet. Heathrow was a nightmare as often happens. Being 5 minutes early was rewarded with a 40-minute wait for a gate, then a 2.5 hour wait for our luggage, absolutely shocking in Covid times."
381,"✅ Trip Verified |  My flight yesterday 18/12/2021 was due to take off at 1215, soon after reaching the gate first passengers were called for pre-boarding, then gate staff said the aircraft has not been given permission to land at Aberdeen due to poor weather. Airport information kept telling passengers to go to gate for a further hour and a half before passengers learned the flight had been cancelled via the BA APP, we then had to join a line for the customer service desk, it took two hours to reach the desk in my case, on reaching the desk I was told I had automatically been booked on the following mornings flight and being offered overnight hotel. That did not meet my needs so I requested cancellation and to get my bags back, I was told to cancel my booking on the BA APP, they could not do it at the desk. I was then directed via a gate to collect my bags, this meant having to go via the UK border to reach a baggage belt, then I waited for my bags for 3 hours because they had automatically stored my bags for the following days flight. BA staff were rude and dismissive of customer complaints at length of time bags were taking to arrive, like it was our fault for cancelling the alternative flight they had offered the next day."
382,"✅ Trip Verified |  It is first time we have flown BA business class in a 777 aircraft and hopefully it will be the last. Firstly, the check-in and crew were great - friendly and helpful. It was manual check-in, not a machine, which is always much nicer. No complaints at all in that department. Food on the journey was adequate but no choice of starter, or desert and 3 choices for main course, Business class seating is 2-4-2 with alternate seats facing backwards, as are both the centre seats. We were in those, so you are either facing a stranger on the aisle seat, or you put the screen up  and you are in a claustrophobic bubble. You cannot see out. You cannot see other passengers. It was slightly better as it was my wife and myself, but it would be utterly awful to be shut in this space with a stranger.  Nowhere to put a glass, bottle of water, book, or glasses within easy reach, unless you keep the table down. In most business class seats you can tuck your bag under the seat in front for take off and landing, but there is nowhere to put a bag, so everything has to go in the overhead locker, and they are missing over the first 4 rows of centre seats, so not much storage space. We were in row 1 and to get out you have to climb over the legs and leg rest of the person in the aisle seat in row 2. Now if you are travelling solo in the centre seats that is always the case, but normally if, as a couple, you take aisle and centre at least you are climbing over your partner's legs, not some stranger. I am 5ft 10 and could just about manage. My wife at 5ft 4 could not get over without disturbing the passenger in the row behind. The reading light was hopeless and did not shine on your book and the light controlled from the handset did not work at all. This is utterly awful design and will certainly make us avoid BA in future, if at all possible."
383,"✅ Trip Verified |  I claimed my miles right after my trip at the beginning of August, they took almost 4 months to reply and to my surprise to reject my request without providing any reasons. I have sent them a complaint per E-mail and I still didn't get a reply. It has been 4.5 months and I am still waiting for an answer. Furthermore, many people were not wearing masks and when I asked the flight attendants why they were allowing people not to wear the masks they said there are medical exceptions. When we ordered more drinks they replied that we needed to pick them out ourselves, what a business class customer service."
384,"✅ Trip Verified | British Airways is taking reservations and then cancelling flights without giving any reasons. We had further plans that all needed to be cancelled because of the flights. BA did nothing to ease the process and offered absolutely no explanation of why the flight was cancelled, I am not going to travel on BA again and may not travel again this year at all."
385,"✅ Trip Verified |  I have a flight booked for January 2022, they send me an email at the beginning of December informing me that my flight was changed. My second flight was moved to the next day, making my layover 26 hours, called them, was told to just cancel. What kind of answer is that? I mean I still need to fly to where I am going, and booking with another airline closer to the day I am flying will be more expensive. It is a very big inconvenience for me and I don't even get an apology, just cancel!"
386,"✅ Trip Verified |  I had a future travel voucher for Singapore to London which I thought would be perfect for my flight to relocate home. I'd been under the impression that it was a simple process - just call up and book onto the same route that I'd previously paid for (and that had previously been cancelled by BA themselves) - but on a new date. How wrong I was. First, I had to pay to top up my flight - a significant amount, equivalent to around the value of my original flight which was a redemption ticket of part cash part airmiles. This was because of price increases and the fact that I was flying at peak times. The extra charge also meant that I overall paid more than face value (their online price at the time for the ticket) for the flight, as well as them still keeping the airlines I'd redeemed. They explained that the online price and redemption prices differ and that's just how the system works. However, if I had taken a refund I would have lost a lot of money to administration fees. They had me in a desperate situation where I was losing hundreds of pounds to them no matter what I did, so I cut my losses and booked the flight. Or at least I thought I did. The call centre agent - who had previously explained she was working remotely with no manager or supervision (and no way to escalate issues) - took my card details (including full card number, dates, and CVC code) - and explained my flight ticket and receipt for payment for an extra bag would follow. A week later, I still had no ticket, no details, no charge to my card, no booking reference - nothing. I called up to confirm. The call centre agent I reached apologised and advised he would escalate it to the bookings team and again took my card details. Once again, I waited another week, and sign of being booked onto a flight. Thus began a cycle of increasingly frequent and desperate calls to British Airways as they repeatedly failed to do the simple task of booking me on a flight, spanning over 6 weeks.  On the Friday before my Monday flight, I sat in tears to another BA call centre agent who promised to get me on my flight and book my extra bag. The next day - around 48 hours before I was due to fly, I finally got my booking reference yet they still failed to charge me for or add on my extra bag. Luckily, I noticed this on my check in details and managed to add a bag online. The whole experience was stressful, costly, and resulted in me spending hours and days on the phone listening to British Airways hold music. Furthermore, there has been a significant cutback to BAs inflight catering service due to COVID, resulting in smaller portions, leaving me quite hungry on such a long flight. Though I've flown BA repeatedly with few problems in the past, their service has gone significantly downhill."
387,"✅ Trip Verified |  Extremely disappointed In trip experience. I am Gold MVP 100,000+ miler with Alaska Airlines. My ticket and travel wasnt linked with Alaska Airlines. When speaking with Alaska representative, they confirmed it was due to lack of effort on British Airways In accomplishing this task. I could over look the lack of effort on this even though frustrating. The Main issue is the ticketing and Flt connection process.  I departed Egypt this morning with connecting tickets in hand. Once I arrived in USA apparently my Alaska (AS 2449) flt was changed to a 5 hour later flight with a completely different airline (Delta). Who does that without notifying the customer. I found this out when trying to go through security In Seattle, they said my ticket was not valid. I had to go to Alaska Airline to find out What the issue was. They explained British Airways had rebooked with Delta. This took about 30mins with customer Service. Then i had to go to Delta to sort the mess out. I am so frustrated."
388,"✅ Trip Verified |  British Airways seems happy to encourage the spread of Covid. Took the 7am flight from T5 at Heathrow to Paris CDG on 22nd November, which was boarded by bus from a remote gate. The bus driver insisted on packing the bus to its maximum possible load, standing by the door and telling customers to squeeze right up and he was not leaving the terminal until the bus was full. The result was that passengers in the bus were packed tight and the maximum facial distancing was about 15cms! A second coach to the aircraft followed just a few minutes later and had about 15 customers on it. It is shameful that BA ground staff exercise no control and did nothing to check the bus boarding process, and whilst the flight was okay, this serves to underline how BA seem happy to disregard any Covid-19 safety protocols in the airport environment. In contrast, on recent Air France and Iberia flights, their ground staff are much more disciplined and actually try to control customers. Maybe this underlines the very laissez faire attitude to Covid that now prevails in the UK. "
389,✅ Trip Verified |  I was refused an early check in and was told to come back at 2:30pm for a 5.05pm departure. There was no staff until 2:45 and both staff members were very inexperienced with poor attitude taking up a lot of time for each passenger.
390,"✅ Trip Verified | Check in was ok, all documents were scanned without problems. The flight was delayed by 50 minutes due to crew members been stuck on the M25. Not the airlines fault. 3 replacement crew where found and boarding onto a new A321 neo went ahead. The club Europe cabin was 12 rows of economy seats with the middle seat blocked off. For me at 5.11 tall, I can fit ok, however anyone taller than me might struggle with limited leg room. The inflight service was a a stop - start affair, nothing to write home about. The crew failed to work as a team. You had to go to the galley to get extra drinks. I was even served cool coffee with filter paper in the bottom of the cup. Landing and disembarking went without a hitch and included a bus ride to the terminal. Not BA's finest hour."
391,"✅ Trip Verified | Arrived at the South airport in Tenerife 2 hours before departure, Iberia had not opened the check in. Even with a full flight waiting, the usual check in process post COVID took place, with the usual errors in the paperwork slowing things down. Passing security was fine and Iberia had a lounge with 160 person capacity to serve drinks and a simple selection of cold food. Boarding was done by a 15 meter long bus ride as the plane was parked at the gate. Not sure why. The plane was a very new A321 neo, with 14 rows of club seating. The seat was ok for a 4 hour flight, but anything longer and I would expect club Europe to have more leg room than the couple of inch’s between my knee and the seat in front. Food and drink where very good, served with steel cutlery and glass tumblers. Good selection of wine to go with a above average salad. Overall it was an OK experience with a great cabin crew."
392,"Not Verified |  Check-in very slow. No app check-in and could not check my vaccine QR code online. Check in staff friendly but too few of them. BA Silver card holder and no Stockholm lounge  to use. Boarding fine, but plane was worn out. Seats close together and row 30 even worse.  Crew really professional and happy it seemed. Arrival at Heathrow a total shambles. BA777 landed at 12.50, no gate so waited and waited for 25 minutes. Then BA jetty didn’t work. Then BA had no steps. Very slow to leave plane as only moderately mobile wheelchair passengers struggle down the steps. Everyone was very patient and supportive but it was terrible to watch. So BA skimping on lounge, plane condition and gate. Crew good, seats very uncomfortable."
393,"✅ Trip Verified |  After 1h queuing at the check-in desk, I am told that my booked seat is not available. Why do you sell seats that you do not have?"
394,"Not Verified |  Outbound, seated in row 10, I was told they had run out of my chosen food option (shepherd's pie), so I had to settle for gnocchi. The steward had the temerity to blame the food supplier - as if BA could not get a better one! On the return, boarding from the back, not by priority, then, seated in row 12, I had the last half glass of champagne (only because one of the other passengers in row 12 had declined). Food was rigatoni with vegetables. Overall, penny pinching by BA in club class. Dreadful - not for us again."
395,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew Club Europe London - Tenerife South 5 November and returned 12 November. Club Europe seats are not comfortable - you pay a lot more for exactly the same leg room but have the middle seat of 3 empty to spread out a tiny bit. For the fare I would hope for at least a couple more inches of leg room - it would make a huge difference. We did at least get a meal (outbound cottage pie and inbound sausage and mash) which were not too bad and a drinks service. However, on the inbound BA had no white wine - apparently there is a problem with their suppliers. Did not pre-book seats due to the extortionate fees for pre booking. Just about any other airline will not charge for pre booking a seat if you are in premium classes. Back to the flights: both in a new, or nearly near A320, both very smooth with no timing issues at all so all good in that respect. Not a good check in experience at Tenerife South - just tacked onto the end of a large Tui check in queue. Also not a great lounge - the VIP lounge is merely adequate with OK seating for an hour or two. I would only just about recommend - there are still reservations about exactly what BA is trying to become."
396,"✅ Trip Verified | 3 hours standing in line for boarding pass. Airline would not allow me to obtain boarding pass electronically. Then they said the flight was overbooked so my adult daughter got bumped from the flight. And yes, we used VeriFLY. My flight is now delayed for at least 30 minutes. They are so unorganized and slow! Getting a seat in advanced is not performed like other airlines. You have to wait even though I paid for it. Avoid this airline at all costs! Absolute worst!"
397,"✅ Trip Verified | I have been trying to get a hold of BA to change my return flight for the past week now. I cant change online because I'm flying out of another city so the service is unavailable online. I've tried live chat several times and waited 2.5 hours only to be told there's no one available (during business hours). I have tried calling and the line always drops from their end. Customer service is non existent. However, of course if you call the ""new booking"" line someone immediately picks up of course, however they can't help me nor put me through to anyone apparently. Shambolic excuse of an airline that doesn't deserve to be a national airline. I haven't had these problems at all and I've been flying throughout covid (for work unfortunately). It's been easier to change my flights with domestic Latin American Airlines and I don't even speak Spanish. "
398,"✅ Trip Verified |  This whole experience was sickening, over 3.5 grand spent on the holiday and their customer service is a shambles. Drop down menu to drop down menu not stating what I wanted to complain about. Would not even allow me to add tier points. The flight to London was marred with problems. In London we received an upgrade email to fast track and VIP lounges due to amount spent. This never happened and treated as paupers wherever we showed the email. We had to change planes to the other side of the airfield. The resort (Riu Paradise Beach) was riddled with bad food, drugs and bad attitude and when you complained you were fobbed off as they knew there was no BA staff to sound off too. The return journey was a shambles and more delays finally arriving back at Manchester completely exhausted and needing another holiday. There is light at the end of this horrid tunnel Virgin Atlantic have just started the same route from this month. Now we all know this is a better option."
399,"Not Verified |  Poorly mismanaged services this time. Disappointed with the huge queues due to unavailability of attendants at the counters, had to wait around 1.5 hours just to check in. Then came the boarding, again had to wait at the passage for 15-30 mins. Finally when we thought things are better now, on reaching London our next boarding pass was not scanned. Around 15-20 passengers including me had to wait from 7.45 am until 1.40 am for the next flight. On boarding the next flight, no space to keep the luggage. Journey was really hectic and did not expect this from BA."
400,Not Verified |  Currently dreading my flight with BA considering they have hung up on me and mum on the customer service line twice now and will not reply via the so called “Live Chat”. All we wanted to find out was how there were two flights booked under my mums name plus a flight for my dad and not one for me. We just wanted to be able to make a name change. Absolutely impossible. Their website is unusable. Their customer service is a shambles. They couldn’t change the name. Told me that we should’ve done the booking more carefully. Well you’re going to have these people making mistakes. So maybe change your website so that we can make changes to our flights. Like hello it’s the 21st century. You should have a button saying “Change name”. Anyways not the point. The woman on the phone started raising her voice at us because she wasn’t making it clear on what to do. Then when I gave up towards the end of the call I just said “thanks for your help I’ll deal with it la-“ got cut off. 50 minutes and got nothing. All I can say is good luck.
401,✅ Trip Verified | Another BA shuttle flight and a good one. Fantastic flying weather and I would say a 40% load factor. Good professional crew. Friendly and complimentary snack arrived early so now worries. And getting to the A gates at T5 makes for an easy exit. Still a cut above their competitors although a bit more expensive they make up for that in total product delivery.
402,"✅ Trip Verified | Flight from Larnaca to LHR. Check in was ok. The lounge was an Aspire lounge and shared, it was basic but ok. Flight left 20 minutes late but made up time en route. There were 13 rows to the business class cabin on this A321. Service was ok but it was quite expensive for the product offered. It’s a long sector and the food wasn’t great. Drinks were ok but the staff kept going on about a lack of glassware, not really interested if I’m being honest when we’ve paid a lot of money for it. Staff were friendly and as responsive as they could be. Club Europe is fine for flights less than three hours but not for longer. The seats are not so comfortable. Not dreadful but something for BA to think about."
403,"✅ Trip Verified |  Upon checking in at the Club desk in Lisbon airport our Passenger Locator Forms were found to have an incorrect reference number for our Day 2 test and the check in agent denied us boarding, causing my wife, who had recently spent some long time in hospital in the U.K., much distress. He was only doing his job of course, but we requested him to call a Supervisor. The Check in Manager, Goncalo Ribeiro, came to our rescue.  Not only did he identify the problem but spent half an hour of his time arranging a new supplier for our Day 2 test, uploading it onto our PLF’s, verifying our flight documentation and fast tracking us through check-in. He was at the Gate on boarding to wish us a comfortable journey; we could not have asked for better service. He was a very professional ambassador for BA!"
404,"✅ Trip Verified | Club Europe on British Airways. Outstanding and wonderful to have BA back. The welcome on board was warm and sincere. Flight attendants helpful, friendly and professional. Great updates from the flight deck. Super lunch and good choice of wines. BA at its best. Hopefully this excellence is also a reflection of a new CEO with the departure of Alex Cruz."
405,"Not Verified |  Good flight but boarding was chaos, was gifted with the beautiful A10 gate at LHR T5(, so we were bussed to the plane (first time I've used a bus gate there). The A320 was at T3 at a gate with a jetway, nevertheless 168 passengers (full flight) boarded via steps - this caused an hour waiting at the ""gate"" as well as the baggage taking ages. Also the seat recline on G-GATL (9f) is broken."
406,"✅ Trip Verified |  Usual BA economy trip, pleasant crew. Complimentary snack and water and small bar service which has reasonable prices. I am not a fan of the new NEO aircraft. Very cramped seating and uncomfortable. The armrests between seats are tiny thin and short in length and offer little support for two people and not enough for one. Aisle width seems smaller and going to the toilets at the back seems awkward. I have done a transatlantic on this aircraft with another airline and it’s not for me. Other than that BA still offers a good product that can be good value or over priced. This time it was good value."
407,"✅ Trip Verified |  Check in was easy, security quick, lounge fine. Lounge service returning to pre pandemic days and some self service allowed (which was great). Flight was fine, my wife and son felt breakfast was more like old style economy food and perhaps I agree. There was nothing bad about food but nothing great either. Drinks were fine and proactively served. On arrival efficient PCR testing where it was needed and fast turnaround. Baggage off quick"
408,"Not Verified |  What has happened to British Airways? The whole pre-flight experience now is prehistoric, they appear to have gone back to the 80’s and now make passengers physically queue to manually check in adding hours to the journey not to mention how ridiculous it is to bunch people together in a big slow queue. On the premise it’s due to covid precautions! They are the only airline making passengers do this and they can’t even open all the desks so for 200 passengers they had two check in staff, like the post office in 1980! Apart from the aircraft and cabin crew literally everything else about this airline has disintegrated to the point where they’re just not reliable enough to use for business purposes and their attitude towards exec club members and other loyal customers is a disgrace. I’ve chosen and insisted upon BA for business and personal travel for decades and accumulated a lot of air miles, I also have not one but two BA Amex companion vouchers that cost me 40k of spending to earn so that tells you how much I’ve supported this airline despite their shocking decline in recent years. In the last year I’ve booked 6 BA flights, 1 personal and 5 business flights for me and two colleagues but after taking my money and wasting my time planning the itineraries, 5 of the 6 have been cancelled forcing me to tear up my plans and pay double for last minute alternatives with other airlines, the personal one to St Lucia they cancelled my return 2 days after flying me out forcing me to cancel my holiday and fly back immediately or risk being stuck there for 6 weeks. That cost me my £2500 holiday and they offered nothing by way of compensation! A couple of weeks ago I noticed that one of my Amex companion vouchers was apparently going to expire on Nov 12th this year so I tried to speak to them. As the World has largely been closed since March 20 I assumed it would be straightforward to extend the voucher to a time there are holiday destinations properly open, not to mention my experiences dealing with routinely cancelled flights and my reluctance to risk a third person on another holiday, but after 2 days going around in circles speaking really bad English to people who have no empathy for me or even live in the same country I finally got through to someone at BA who told me that no they won’t extend the voucher! I’m even a shareholder but after this level of treatment and disrespect I will not spend another penny with this airline, I’m not even going to bother using my second voucher and I’ve cancelled my BA Amex. I work in the music business managing tours for bands so I reckon I book 1000 flights a year and my only satisfaction is knowing their attitude has cost them that! Roll on the inevitable BA administration but at least somebody else can buy it for cheap and start rebuilding what was once the Worlds Favourite Airline but now the most ridiculed. Who’d have thought BA could ever make Ryanair look like an attractive option."
409,"✅ Trip Verified |  I have just returned from an amazing holiday and felt compelled to write a review. The flight is generally a torment for me being a nervous flyer, however, on this occasion it was an absolute delight. On both inward and outward journeys, I was impressed by the professionalism, friendliness and kindness of the cabin crew. I was in economy but was treated with the respect and service I would expect in the first class cabin. My particular thanks must go to Amir, who was absolute joy and a credit to British Airways. I cannot wait to fly again with you and that from me is huge, Thank you so so much."
410,"✅ Trip Verified |  The plane was clean and air quality very good. Timing was perfect. I was seated in 15 K. To begin with , I had difficulty using the buttons to get the leg rest up as well as push back the seat. When I requested a cup of tea just as the drink service started, I was told that tea would be served after dinner. I did press the loght twice to indicate my need and nothing happened. At dinner, there was no tea service. I did get up and go to the galley and ask for a cup of tea.  There was no hand soap in the washroom. However, on my way to London from Toronto, my experience was a good one. However, it was not the same on my return flight."
411,✅ Trip Verified |  The service was excellent. The cabin staff were attentive and efficient. The food and drinks were very good. The seat in the new suites is extremely comfortable and the additional privacy is really nice. Overall a very enjoyable flight.
412,"Not Verified |  I booked and paid for what I thought was a business class seat on a flight to Athens. What I got was a premium economy seat. The first nine rows were business class seats, rows 10 to 16 were what should have been the premium economy cabin (but had been added to the business class section) which had less comfortable seats that didn’t fully recline, unlike the seats in rows 1 to 9 (I was in row 11). This is not a case of me being snobby, but simply a point of principle and a clear case of BA mis-selling. Had I known prior that I would be paying the same business class price but for seats that were less comfortable than other business class passengers on the same flight, I wouldn’t have booked. I complained on board along with several other passengers who also resented being scammed in that way. I also made a formal complaint to BA but was fobbed off. Apparently this is a long running scam, I don’t know how they get away with it."
413,"✅ Trip Verified |  Terrible customer service. Booked my flight before Covid. Couldn’t go, still can’t go as borders are still closed. I wasn’t given an option just told I have to take a voucher. Now I have no job and no plans to travel and they refuse to give me my money back although I booked for a flight for Cayman and I still haven’t been able to go. They cannot provide the service I paid for and refuse to refund me. They are not sympathetic or understanding.  The voucher is valid for another two years, I wonder how many flights will go up by then. I wonder how many more regulations there will be. I’ve been such a good customer and feel I deserve better. "
414,"✅ Trip Verified | This was my first flight during the pandemic, so it was understandable the difficulties facing airlines. Check-in was longer than normal due to the vaccine checks and passenger locator forms etc. But on the return flight, it was a total mess. Just two counters open for economy and one for business. There were arguments regarding vaccine checks, where two BA staff were contradicting each other. It took an hour and ten minutes just to check in, resulting in the flight delay. On board, I was not expecting great service.  Seating was extremely uncomfortable, 29 inch pitch and 17 inch wide seats - just about bearable for an hour and a half flight.  On board service was a packet of crisps and a small bottle of water from another, no eye contact with me just handed out. However, I was pleased that disembarking passengers were let out in groups, despite a few idiots who decided to stand a up to get their hand luggage out while the aircraft is was still taxing to the gate. The cabin crew did manage to force them back to their seats and close the lockers."
415,"✅ Trip Verified | LCA to LHR in Club Europe. Quick check-in at LCA with speedy passport control and security. Aspire lounge was clean and spacious with reasonable buffet food and drink. Boarding by group and pushback on time. CE stretched back a full 15 rows and the single toilet struggled. Drinks and meal service was efficient despite the many rows, but the vegetarian option was the usual pasta splodge and reminiscent of economy of yore. Onboard W-Fi was adequate, if rather slow, and it shouldn't be charged for in business class. Arrival ahead of schedule. Disembarking en masse and through e-gates surprisingly quickly. Overall, a flight that was typical of the post-COVID standard for short-haul business class."
416,"Not Verified |  I had booked a flight from Heathrow on Friday 27th August 2021 to fly to Manchester Airport. On arrival at Heathrow to check in, the British Airways staff informed me that I had booked both flight seats in my name by mistake. I offered to pay a fee to get the second seat changed to my sister's name but British Airways refused us to board and sent us home. However, the staff member who I spoke to at the desk promised to email us flight vouchers which I would get shortly so that I could fly at another time with BA since they do not offer refunds. I never received these flight vouchers. I have chased numerous times on the phone with BA staff who said that it was my error and that no flight vouchers would be sent to me. They have no record that a staff member spoke to me and promised these vouchers, they say I was just a 'no show' which is inaccurate. I have sent numerous emails to BA explaining what happened and asking form my promised vouchers. I have had no response to my emails/messages. One BA staff member on the phone said that I should track down the lady I spoke to at Heathrow and ask her if she remembers me. So ludicrous as I did not take her name and I doubt she would remember me since she sees hundreds of BA customers a day. "
417,"✅ Trip Verified |  We have flown with BA for many years and never will again where there is an alternative. Booked and paid for Club class flights. Didn't receive a meal or drinks onboard, crew were so unorganised. We were delayed on the ground for 30 minutes prior to departing so they had plenty of time to prepare but the in-flight service was delayed once up in the air. They commenced the service, albeit very slowly, then abandoned it and closed the service altogether. The crew never even had the decency to speak to us to apologise in person or even over the tannoy.  Complained to BA and received an apology by email with the usual ""we fell short of our standards"" generic speech, but no offer of any partial refund or Avios to compensate for the lack of service. "
418,✅ Trip Verified |  The crew at Denver airport is top notch! So impressed with their customer service. They were very patient and courteous. Thank you all for being amazing.
419,✅ Trip Verified |  An ordinary BA domestic shuttle flight from Belfast to London Heathrow. Usually uneventful except for the cabin crew announcement three times advising people complete a UK passenger arrival form from the gov.uk website or risk prosecution. Some people challenged this statement and were rebuked. BA Cabin Crew were adamant that this was now a requirement. But the regular traveller amongst us knew this was incorrect advice. Some people were anxious departing the aircraft. Other than that crisp snacks and water were offered which is a nice touch. Sky Cafe still not on sale - not quite sure why given COVID protocols in the UK are mainly relaxed now. BA is still by far the best operator from Ulster to England.
420,Not Verified |  I’ve had to book six flights with BA recently. All have either been cancelled or had a significant time change. The latest flight was so late into Heathrow we missed our connecting flight even though we’d scheduled around 2 hours between flights. BA staff at Heathrow were rude and generally clueless for the most part. They couldn’t get us to our destination within 24 hours of our scheduled arrival time. We booked an easyJet flight from Gatwick instead and had to pay to get ourselves to Gatwick. A complaint was registered several weeks ago with no response so far. Perhaps BA have a backlog of complaints the way they are performing at the moment. It’s an embarrassment that our national flag carrier is being comfortably out performed by budget airlines but that appears to be the case at the moment.
421,✅ Trip Verified |  The service is got super inconsistent on BA and the management of our diverted flight was unprofessional and lacked any shred of empathy. The flight down from London I was in business class I asked for the mini bottle of champagne that I always treat myself to the cabin crew member said I can’t give you the bottle only a glass. However the other crew member was giving bottles to other passengers in row one and two we were in 3. I asked for a top up and staff said not until they were finished the business cabin in case they would run Out. The crew should not pick and choose one passenger over another and change the service that is not fair. We got diverted as volcano ash was impacting Tenerife we needed to refuel at Gran Canaria 20 mins from Tenerife but we were diverted to Malaga. We got an e mail clearly stating meals and accommodation the crew also said the same - we got to the hotel and no dinner for us and there was no room service. Breakfast was at eight but our bus to the airport was also at eight all we could do at 7.50 was to grab something from the buffet and run to the coach. I have been on diverted flights before we got dinner and  breakfast.
422,"✅ Trip Verified | Such terrible service in Club World. Such indifference and lackadaisical attitude. Hardly any service. Everything has to be asked for and gotten. Asked for a cup of tea and had the flight say..'whaa' and then when I said cup of tea she said yes...asked if wanted milk and sugar. Brought to me lukewarm tea with 2 sugar sachets, no spoon or stirrer. Pushed the bell for stirrer and had to wait a full 3 mins before someone came by, eventually for a spoon and had to drink cold tea. Seriously BA...what are you doing? Is this how you welcome back people to fly?"
423,✅ Trip Verified |  LHR to LCA. Galleries Lounge chock-a-block first thing on a Wednesday morning and T5 seemed as bustling as pre-pandemic. Boarding by groups efficient and flight almost full. Superficially the cabin seemed clean although long hairs on pillows gave the game away. Expanded Club Europe stretching back 12 rows - the new norm? Departure on time. Good drinks service which sequed smoothly into lunch. Post-COVID lunch remains restricted - Do&Co must be horrified by what they're having to produce: miniscule salads and the worst gnocchi dish I've ever tasted. Wi-Fi access wasn't free for business class passengers: £4.99 for an hour of intermittent service is excessive. Arrival ahead of schedule and no issues with passport control at LCA.
424,"✅ Trip Verified |  Very pleasant flight to Lisbon! It was a full flight and we left about 10min late as we were taken to the aircraft by bus at Heathrow and the gate staff allow too much hand luggage to the aircraft. However, in the air great service by the 3 male crew on a big Club class cabin. Friendly and efficient crew even to some demanding and obnoxious passengers. Late breakfast/brunch served was tasty. What a contrast to the Iberia crew (Lisbon/Madrid/London) who were cold and unprofessional."
425,"✅ Trip Verified | No check in staff for Economy. Never experienced this before. While Business passengers strolled up, Economy passengers were left standing for 90 mins plus."
426,"✅ Trip Verified |  No refund for flights cancelled 14 months ago but provided a ticket voucher valid until 30 April 2022. Tickets bought on Edreams on June 16, 2020 for a flight on July 7, 2020, from Geneva to São Paulo through London (British Airways), round trip. The LHR-GRU flight was cancelled without any explanation. I contacted both Edreams and BA a number of times in the last 14 months but they did not refund the 461 Euros that I paid."
427,✅ Trip Verified |  Stranded in the lounge because I wasn't allocated a seat. This for a flight that I booked months ago. I didn't want to use them but was forced to because Emirates wasn't available. I advise travelers to shun them too and look for more customer friendly options.
428,"✅ Trip Verified |  I think British Airways needs to be much clearer about what their Covid-19 ""travel flexibility"" really means, because it doesn't pass the common-sense test: I purchased a round-trip business class ticket from New York to-and-from Mykonos through London. I traveled there with no problem. The day before my return to New York, though, I took my Covid-19 test and learned that I tested positive. I tried to call the airline on the many usless numbers they provide on their website. The recorded message drones on and on about how they have no one to answer the phone because of Covid safety and simply says ""therefore we can't answer your call; try again."" No ability to leave a call-back number or a voicemail, etc. For whatever reason the BA website thought that I had bought the ticket through a third-party agent (I did not - I bought it on BA.com) and so wouldnt let me cancel or reschedule the flight on the web site. I called and called over the coming days and could not get through to the London, Athens or New York lines. Two days later after having 2 negative PCR tests (the most accurate test), I learned I was not positive and so had to buy a new $5000 return flight to the U.S. I've now been calling the BA USA customer service line for nearly a month at least every other day, never to get through. Finally did and have been told that the fact that I couldnt get on the flight because of a COVID scare counts for nothing. The fact they dont have enough people answering the phone counts for nothing. Or that I was unable to change the flight to a few days later on the web site becuase the ticket was mis-booked. They have offered that if I send them a Greek doctor's note saying that I was sick, then they'll give me a voucher for a future flight from Mykonos to New York. I am speechless at the stupidity of this whole situation. "
429,"✅ Trip Verified |  My flight from Boston to Heathrow arrived in time, but I and other passengers were not allowed to disembark the plane. We were kept in the tarmac for one hour and a half without being given sufficient information about what was causing this delay. Because of this delay, I and other passengers lost the connecting flight to Tirana. I was offered another connecting flight which was 8 hours later from the time of arrival. When I booked this flight, one of the main reasons that made me choose it was the fact that the layover was a little bit more than an hour. Turning it into an 8 hour layover I think is unacceptable and very poor customer service. It shows lack of respect for your clients and lack of commitment by this company to provide to their customers what they were promised and what they paid for. I am very disappointed by this experience."
430,"✅ Trip Verified | Year after year the British Airways (BA) service on the same route (Washington-London) is becoming worse. We just had one bad experience after another on this route in July 2021.  British Airways (BA) notified us that our connection flight to Nice was bumped from 2pm to 6pm so we had to spend an extra 4 hours in the airport during this COVID era. Their website and emails prior to our day of flight kept asking us to check UK.gov for the COVID rules and regulations for transit through London which said that no COVID test was necessary if we could show proof of vaccine, however upon our arrival at the airport they told us we needed to go to the basement to take a COVID test to show negative results. They charged us $250 per person for a rapid COVID test which was an outrage and totally unnecessary. We could have gotten the test done at a cheaper rate had we known that this was a requirement prior to our flight. Food service was horrible (they served food with lots of cheese to me while I had requested a vegan meal due to may dairy allergies). BA damaged our Samsonite luggage and they told us at the airport that we needed to report this online. We have been trying to resolve this issue since July and after asking us for photos like 10 times, they are still giving us the run around. "
431,"✅ Trip Verified |  BA used to be my go to carrier and I am a silver member. However their service seems to have gone hugely downhill. Flights get cancelled, the best alternative flights are offered and whilst in theory you can cancel or amend bookings online or on the app, invariably this is not possible. You cannot contact them by email and you may find yourself sitting on a phone for 40 plus minutes to speak to someone. If they are busy due to cancelled flights they need to employ people to answer calls and emails promptly. I was stunned by the recent cancellation to my Catania flight two weeks before I was due to travel. "
432,"✅ Trip Verified |  The entertainment system was working badly, the screen was freezing every time I wanted to open flight map. Though the aircraft was 8 years only, the window blinds worked with delays. The crew informed passengers that there would be no headphones provided as it was supposed to be a short-haul flight. After flying with Aeroflot and S7 Airlines, I expected to receive an excellent BA service, but I got only a pack of crisps and a tiny bottle of water. I think it’s unacceptable for a non-low-cost carrier to offer service like this. I can get that hot meals on board are now rare. I loved the most comfortable seats in my life! I tend to have problems with sleeping on board, but this time I didn’t even noticed my falling asleep right after takeoff. "
433,✅ Trip Verified |  I flew on British Airways Cheapest Fare which was a Hand Baggage Only fare in Economy Class. Despite this being the cheapest fare you can actually carry two pieces of cabin luggage both weighing up to 23KG each. The value for money here is incredible. The ground staff at London Heathrow are very polite and helpful. The plane was clean and the cabin crew were very smiley and polite. This was a short haul flight but we were given a free packet of crisps and a bottle of water. There was Wifi onboard which we paid £11.99 for the full flight access package and it was great. It was fast enough to stream a movie on Netflix. If you are considering between a low cost carrier and a premium carrier like BA pay the extra and fly with the premium carrier. With the generous cabin luggage allowance and the free snacks on board it may end up being cheaper and nobody claps when the plane lands.
434,✅ Trip Verified |  Very efficient evening bag drop. Security quick. Galleries North lounge was very good. Food and drinks fine. Plane left on time pre ordered door was ok. Early arrival. Fortunately only our bags were not given priority tags and came out early!
435,"✅ Trip Verified |  Me and my 1 year 11 months baby girl flew business class from Moscow Domodedovo to London Heathrow on 11 august. When we landed at Heathrow, my baby was sleeping. I asked stewards for my stroller, and they said it is going to wait for me at the and of the corridor before entrance to terminal building. I grabbed my sleeping baby, who is nearly 15 kg, and luggage bag (another 15 kg) and walked away. I went and entered the building, and met no one with my pram or just my pram left somewhere in this corridor. And there was no one to ask. Just a flow of passengers behind me and in front of me. On top of that, we landed at terminal 5,and I had to travel on a train to arrivals terminal for passport control and other procedures still on my own, holding my baby and heavy bag on my shoulder. I met no one whom I can ask for a help. First British airways representative I met was after passport control , i explained the situation and he said that I have to go downstairs and my pram will be with my suitcases.  No further assistance or help. I had to wait another hour for luggage and pram. I am absolutely frustrated, upset and disappointed! I can see that British Airways do not care about mothers with kids at all."
436,"✅ Trip Verified |  For this flight from Heathrow T5, passengers were piled into the bus and left for 30 mins at the terminal.  Very unhappy passengers - and when confronted the BA transport manager's response was ""sorry - we are still learning"". On arrival at the aircraft a gentleman who came on a wheelchair had no help with his luggage (I helped). Shame - since lounge service was very good. For the flight out from Munich BA had not (re) signed up to the now open lounge in Munich. To me looks like a systemic failing rather than a one off event."
437,"✅ Trip Verified | BA encourage you to download verifly to speed up your check-in, this is absolutely rubbish as the desk staff don’t seem to want this, they want to see the actual forms tests etc! This wasted about 40 minutes and is pointless. The return flight again had no access to the club lounge, you pay for extras such as this as part of the business class ticket price and should by now be made available again (last 2 flight not available at NCE but this is more a part of the Covid experience). On board staff were good although one did joke to another welcome to Ryanair. On board food was very good for a short haul flight."
438,✅ Trip Verified |  They cancelled a flight I booked three months ago for some operational problem at a time where the prices are off the roof. British Airways could not give me any alternatives other than refund or a voucher. 
439,"✅ Trip Verified |  I’ve been flying with BA for years and never had any issues. I recently had to arrange to have surgery in Budapest and naturally wanted to fly BA. So I booked my flights from BHD to BUD via LHR online on their site. Once booked I informed the hospital and confirmed my appointment. The very next day I received an email from BA telling me they had cancelled my flight to BUD but not to worry as they had moved me to an earlier (a much earlier) flight the same day. Only problem was this earlier flight departed around two hours before my flight from BHD arrived. I would have thought that this would have flashed up on their system as being an issue, but seemingly not… *interlude* To get into Hungary during covid one needs a valid reason, with medical treatment being one. I had to fill in a very confusing form on the Hungarian police website that was a confusing mix of Hungarian and pidgin English. Anyway form filled in with flight numbers etc, emailed to the authorities there and exemption granted. So I took the earlier flight but this meant I had to fly into London the previous evening and stay overnight in a hotel. So operation booked, hotel booked, airport transfers booked immigration papers amended and re sent and admiration granted and flights re booked, what could go wrong? Around three weeks before I was due to travel, BA, rather unsportingly, decided to cancel my flight to BUD again. Needless to say I was furious. I complained to BA customer services and was given a stock excuse about covid disrupting air travel. Great excuse, only having looked at BUD arrivals info, Ryanair had been flying there once daily for at least the preceding several months. So BA’s covid excuse rang somewhat hollow. Epilogue: I got refunded most of my money from the flights I booked with BA, although they refused to refund my BHD - LHR flights because who knows? I also lost the money I had spent on a hotel and half of the money I had spent on booking airport transfers. Given the cavalier attitude BA seem to have to bookings and their indifference to ruining weeks of preparation on my part and the fact that I lost a not inconsiderable sum of money, I’ve decided to avoid BA from now on."
440,"✅ Trip Verified |  Check in well organised. No lounge in Cancun. Efficient boarding process. Given water bottle before take off, no welcome drink. Now COVID rules are being relaxed this needs to change. Menu good and food acceptable. Staff were experienced and well organised and gave a very slick on board experience. Managed to sleep a few hours. For the first time my tagged luggage was off quickly. This may reflect the fact that our flight was the only one into Gatwick at that time."
441,"✅ Trip Verified |  Departure LGW north so Aspire lounge. Bag from fine, lounge basic, on time departure. Cabin crew welcoming but only given menu, water and amenity pack. Looks like some of White Company bedding options removed. Lunch was fine and good pre meal drinks service. Not complete return to old days but getting there. Flight generally good. Early touch down. Club world luggage off last which meant a wait of 75 minutes for luggage!"
442,"Not Verified |  Booked flight six months before travel, then month before the flight BA cancelled the flight giving the option to rebook for another day - bearing in mind that people have work and school that wasn't ideal on top of booked parking for over three weeks. We rebooked the flight- as suggested by them and a week later BA cancelled the rebooked flight. We were told that we will receive a refund within 10 working days. Over two weeks passed and I called again. I was informed that they can't give a time frame for processing refunds, and no refund issued yet. BA representative refuses to give contact details to the manager, they cut the phone. "
443,"Not Verified |  The airline cancelled my initial return flight with a 2 hours layover in London, and my only option was to book the next flight that has a 7-8 hours layover. That's before I board the flight to Toronto. While i understand schedule changes, and do my best to stay positive and supportive, i contacted the airline, asking for upgrades to a best seat. I asked for access to the airport lounge during my prolonged stay in the airport. They denied my ask, no explanations and no empathy. Not only that, but they ignored my subsequent ask to provide a path to escalation. Again, not the change in schedule, not the extra 5 hours layover time. Just the way they chose to treat a customer who didn't do anything wrong except trusting them with his commute. "
444,"Not Verified |  I was traveling with my wife in business class from Seattle to Bangalore via connecting flight in London and we reserved our seats together while booking the tickets. But mysteriously they changed it later and when we got our boarding pass, they assigned 11h and 5d. Called several times but they couldn't do anything and gave us explanations like may be some one else needed those seats and there are no other seats together available. When we boarded, the whole plane was empty and still they didn't allow us to seat together. "
445,"✅ Trip Verified |  I usually avoid BA because of its appalling customer service and sneaky extra charges, but this flight was my only option. Note that BA actually charges for seat pre-selection in biz class -- 100 UK pounds in this case! Does any other airline in the world dare do that? I saved the money and waited until checkin to choose my seat for free. The seats were BA's universally derided, cramped 6-across back-to-front configuration, where you stare into the face of your seat mate an arm's length away. No other airline ever came up with this awkward arrangement --- I wonder why? No preflight drink was offered. At meal time I selected one of the three main offerings, only to be told it wasn't available -- even though there were only 3 people in my 16 seat biz section. The seat area has practically no storage except a tiny drawer at ankle level that is inaccessible when the seat is in lie flat position. The ""bed"" is the narrowest I have experienced in biz class, and is also very hard. The cabin was very cold and the blanket very thin; I had to raid blankets from two other seats just to stay warm. The amenity kit is the smallest I've ever seen in biz class -- it fits in the palm of the hand. All in all, this uncomfortable, miserly experience is hardly worth the £5,727 that BA charges for this route. I used miles to pay for my ticket -- but of course got whacked with BA's unique and notorious ""fuel surcharge"" fee of $636 for using miles."
446,"Not Verified |  Aktion airport has only recently opened its new facilities and check-in and departure certainly seemed very clean and efficient, although admittedly it’s only having to cope with a low passenger load at present. It was good to see that check-in carefully scrutinised lateral flow certificates and passenger locator forms. Thanks to just 30 passengers on board, with more than half in Club Europe, the flight took off ahead of time. Service was a little perfunctory and the food was more reminiscent of economy than business class, with too much pre-packaging - the COVID effect, presumably. Arrival into T5 was also comfortably ahead of schedule, and although we were dreading many hours of queuing at border control, we were through the e-gates and collecting our luggage just 20 minutes after landing."
447,"✅ Trip Verified |  I want to say a big thank you to Kahina Ladjouze. After frustratingly missing my flight due to M25 road closures, she helped me secure and book the next day flight without additional charges. I am really grateful."
448,"✅ Trip Verified | After sixteen months of being grounded by COVID, it felt almost surreal to be back in T5, heading for what to us was essential summer sun in Greece. T5 was blissfully quiet, with no queues at check-in or security, and even the Galleries South lounge was less frenetic than usual, despite families with kids similarly desperate to escape Boris Johnson’s bully boy attitude. Ordering food and beverages from one’s table seems something worth continuing, avoiding all the wastage of endlessly replenished buffets. The flights was very quiet, with just 30 pax on board, 9 of whom were in Club Europe. Boarding by row also seemed a welcome improvement on the previous ‘groups’. Service on the flight was good and the food was of the usual Do&Co quality. Landing was ahead of schedule and we were through passport control in just a few minutes after a quick check of vaccination certificates and the passenger locator form. Overall, a thoroughly reassuring, coming out of COVID, experience."
449,"✅ Trip Verified | BA cancelled flight in Dec 2020. Refund was promised in voucher form by call center. We are now 6 months down the line, 13 calls of which each is 40 min waiting time, and 16 email reminders. Conclusion is that they are just going in circles to avoid issuing any voucher. Head of call center is keeping to her empty promises."
450,✅ Trip Verified | Fantastic flight down to Heathrow. Crew doing their best to keep everyone happy in challenging times. Nice to see they have introduced a free snack and water. It’s a start.
451,"✅ Trip Verified |  Boarding and disembarking were greatly organised: passengers were boarded at the gate by seperate rows, from the backside to the front (business), minimizing the possiblity for jamming. Same at disembarking: passengers were asked to remain seated, then row per row was called. crew members were supporting the process. What could be improved: distribute hand-sanitizer during boarding. When snack was distributed my row (#8 business) was overlooked for some reason; after a while my seat neighbour highlighted that we did not get food - staff was surprised and fixed it, This was my first flight since one year, and I appreciated the COVID measures taken by BA - still it left some strange experience."
452,"✅ Trip Verified | This was not my best experience with BA thus far as there were a couple of disappointments. I was happy with the fast baggage check-in. This was a bus gate which is not my favourite thing but not a blemish on the airline. The COVID protocols are not as robust as they should be, particularly attendants need to be armed with sanitizer at the cabin entrance. There was a big mix up which I find inexcusable - I and another passenger were allocated the same seat on the same plane, causing a few anxious moments and the friendly attendant had to get me another seat but I don't expect such at this level. Bottles of water were offered to every passenger which was welcome. The plane arrived 10 minutes late."
453,✅ Trip Verified |  Ok flight apart from they cancelled the majority of the outbound and crammed everybody on one flight. After having my return cancelled 3 times I opted for a voucher so I could rebook a new route. I had not been informed before requesting the “E-voucher” and I would need to call up to rebook (I’m in a different country and the phone tariffs are extortion). So not only was my flight cancelled 3 times I wasn’t offered an option to rebook a new flight online I was inconvenienced every step of the way.
454,"✅ Trip Verified | Absolutely appalling experience. British Airways, unfortunately, has lowered it's standards and to my dismay, I've been recently having a much better flying experience with budget airlines rather than BA. Customer service representatives are completely clueless, unprofessional and not bothered.  I recently had my flight cancelled on 3 occasions and the staff weren't interested in helping me return home."
455,"✅ Trip Verified | Had booked the above mentioned flight. But the travel restrictions changed a week before the travel dates. The airline didn’t notify me until I learned that I could not fly with the airlines only at the airport when I went for check-in. It was a single ticket with the company and they said they didn't realise I was flying from Canada to India via London. The restrictions didn't allow any via flights but were ok with direct ones. When I booked a single ticket from Canada to India, how come they didn't realise I couldn't fly? No refund at all. Gave me a credit for me to travel anytime in the next two years, but I don't have any travel plans for the next two years. That means my money is gone? When talking to representatives, they ridiculously put everything on the website agents which was 'Onetravel'. The worst experience ever with an airline. Am a frequent flyer, was trying BA for the first time but now I guess I am never going to fly with you. On my return journey, the other flight gave me a full refund when the new travel restrictions didn't allow them to take me. A poor show with BA."
456,"✅ Trip Verified |  My return flight from Antigua to London was cancelled 2 times. When I call to BA several times their computer system didn’t work and they couldn’t issue new ticket, as the result I had to pay airport price for baggage, as I couldn’t pay online without ticket. They promised to give me compensation of hotel stay, food and travel if complete online form. When I done it, I was asked to submit expenses, but link provided was to lost baggage expenses, not what I claimed. I replied that link is wrong and asked for correct link. They replied that they wouldn’t compensate anything. "
457,Not Verified |  4 cancellations for 1 month! Applying vouchers only to find out they don't work after new cancellation! Terrible stammers. Do not recommend to anyone in Covid restrictions.
458,"✅ Trip Verified |  I had travelled to India for an eye surgery, on my flight back to London Heathrow I was assisted by a member of the cabin crew Madeline Thomas. She was an amazing person as she made sure I was feeling okay as I had come back from my surgery and was traveling by myself. She was more then a nurse and took care of my needs like a mom. She also made sure I had eaten my food and stood by next to me as I was feeling awful because I was in lot of pain"
459,"Not Verified |  I was travelling back from Mexico City on a business trip. Fully aware of the covid safety restrictions at the moment, which the staff do an admirable job with - but nevertheless a lot to say on the state of BA First at the moment. Firstly - no lounge at all at Mexico City Terminal 2. There's a paid lounge, but the check in staff wouldn't help with the details. Mexico City Terminal 1 has functional lounges for AeroMexico working. Not good enough for an expensive ticket. Finally got to board and the staff are incredible - but throughout they were super apologetic as to what was to come. The food was literally inedible in First and staff offered commented as much every time. So for an 11 hour trip in First the option really was chocolate or crisps. The first suite on the flight had visible signs of wear and tear and needs some attention. The seat would not easily convert to a bed. It had scuff marks around it and generally looked a bit shabby. Again, not what you'd expect from a premium product. I left my watch on the flight in error and contacted BA immediately about this. Despite assurances that they have a comprehensive cleaning process during Covid my watch was never found. BA has outsourced their lost and found service to a separate company and in the process they have completely washed their hands on helping out customers. Given that I told them specifically where I'd left the watch I can only assume that one of the cleaning staff decided to keep it. All in all, you pay premium on a flight for additional service. BA isn't offering it at the moment. If it is essential that you have to fly really don't bother with first unless you have to - or go to another airline. The company just don't care."
460,Not Verified |  Charge £700 fee to make an amendment to a booked holiday well in advance. Absolutely disgraceful. Their site says £30 fees for amendments and when you ring up they say that you ticked the terms and conditions box and refer to page 27 of terms and conditions and use it to charge you an extortionate amount.  I received nothing but bad attitude and rudeness from the representative.
461,"Not Verified |  Good service the whole way. Nothing exceptional but it was only a short flight. Plane was clean and refreshments were provided. My only issue is that the flight was packed - understandable as it was just before Chirstmas but surely it is not wise to have strangers sitting so close to each other during a pandemic, even with the masks? My return flight was cancelled but it was easy to transfer to a new flight so no issues there either - just hoping for a little more personal space next time! Also wi-fi did not work. I also liked that they had a system for boarding and disembarking to avoid everyone rushing at the same time, brought in for the pandemic I'm sure but I hope this is something they continue into the future as it made the experience much more pleasant. Value for money marked down only because the Christmas flights were so expensive! To be expected though, I know."
462,"Not Verified |  I entered the plane with a bunch of white flowers and a flight attendant joked that I should have felt obliged to bring the flowers, when she realized that I was going to my Mother's funeral with the flowers she was apologetic (she had no idea why I was bringing in flowers) but the crew were very nice to me during this flight."
463,"✅ Trip Verified |  I was supposed to fly with Aeroflot on the 23rd of December to Moscow. But because Russia has closed its borders, like the majority of other countries, the flight was canceled, and I couldn’t get home. I’ve also tried to fly through Antalya, but the same situation occurred. On my third try, I came to Heathrow and tried to fly away to Cairo. I was declined by another company. Then I went to British Airways. Starting from testing (because Egypt requires tests), as stressful as the whole situation was, the employees were outstanding! (I’m not sure is it connected to BA, but still, I want to mention this). The crew was very helpful and extremely understanding, very professional and urgent to help, they have been a great help and I am very gracious for this. I want to separately point out one employee - Shanell (if I am not mistaken, who works at Collision testing center in Heathrow Terminal 5). She is a savior and most importantly a human, which is very rare nowadays! Carrying on, I went to BA check-in, but unfortunately couldn’t do it, as my results didn’t go through yet. However, another outstanding employee who provided great help called her colleagues and arranged for the booking to be frozen until the results arrive. I’ve come to her 3 times with additional questions, and every time she was very patient, professional, and happy to help. After I got my results I came back to Heathrow on 24th, but unfortunately, there were no flights to Cairo, the situation became even more complicated (I will spare the details). However, here again, brilliant employees of BA offered their personal assistance and showed sympathy and humanity towards me. The nicest lady I’ve ever met, unfortunately, I didn’t catch her name, but I am aware it was her first day at BA and that she is Egyptian, followed me throughout my struggles, offered me emotional and professional support. She tried to find any possible ways for me to get back home and actually did. She was open to any kind of help and was enormously helpful for which I can’t thank her enough. She also asked her colleague to help me, which he kindly did.  Lastly, the nice lady (shame I don’t know her name) also shared my struggles with her colleague Mani who came to substitute her on the position. He was very friendly and attentive as well, talked me through the process, offered different ways I can stay at the airport, gave his phone to call, and offered to drop me off at the hotel, which he did not have to do whatsoever. To conclude, I merely want to thank all of these individuals one more time, as they have been a great help both in physical and mental aspects, I honestly do not know what would I do if I haven’t met them. I don’t know was I just lucky to meet these people or all BA employees are of the same morality, but I do want to thank BA for hiring and providing jobs for these great human beings as well as upholding the standard for other airlines! For some people, the help that was provided to me might seem like a normal thing to do. However, for me, it was a pleasant and so much needed surprise. As no one in"
464,"✅ Trip Verified |  Dubai to London on 5th December. Flight was ok - seat comfortable enough, crew reasonably friendly but my food was gross.  Both flights almost full with little social distancing and plenty of mixed groups sat next to each other. Lots of passengers with masks below nose or not on at all. When coming back to Heathrow many seemed to have below their nose. Announcement made at the beginning about masks. Crew challenged a couple of people at beginning of flight for not having them on or below nose but seemed to give up at the end. When leaving plane good number had already taken off yet nothing. On way back not a single maskless or incorrectly worn mask challenged. A guy opposite me had his mask below nose the whole flight. He had a conversation with several attendants neither of whom said anything.  Not like the crew were busy either, did 2 services the whole flight then rest of the time didn’t see them. Of course flying in these times is a risk but those risks can be reduced by passengers wearing masks, enforced by the airlines."
465,"✅ Trip Verified | This is my first flight since January. We have had three cancellations which BA handled superbly. But this flight went ahead. Check in at LHR was fine, no fast track se unity at T5. Galleries South lounge open, they have an app system, it seemed to work well and my breakfast arrived quickly. Followed this with a shower (they are open-limited hours). Flight on time and well presented A321. Staff worked hard, nice drinks run, the packed lunch was not dissimilar to the old short haul economy product but was fine in these times. Landed on time, priority baggage cane off late. Overall, happy with product and would use again."
466,"Not Verified |  I had a direct flight from London to Lahore and travelling with them was a nightmare. They did not have milk for my son's bottle, didn't even give warm water for his formula milk. No kids meals, no snacks. Meal portion size was tiny, 1/4 glass of juice. You literally have to beg them for drinks water etc.. Staff was so rude and treated us like trash. If you compare them with Emirates, I would give Emirates 10/10 and British airways 2/10. It's not at all child friendly. I will never travel with them again."
467,"Not Verified |  Overall I have to say I am really pleased with the service BA provided, given the circumstances which must be particularly challenging for airlines. I had to call BA a few times regarding both my outbound and return flight and I would rate their customer service 10/10. Everyone I talked to was extremely friendly and helpful, one employee even tried to help me figure out the recently updated arrival regulations from an Italian website and listened to my rant about constantly changing restrictions and quarantines. I was refunded promptly for part of my flight that had been cancelled and I was able to change my return flight to a completely different route and date with only a minimal charge. They have really shown flexibility here, which is needed when travelling in 2020. The flight itself was fine and I appreciate that food and drink options are currently a bit limited, given that everyone should wear their mask as much as possible rather than sipping tea. The one thing - which I mean as constructive criticism though - I think BA could improve is a little more exchange with their destination airports. The arrival sheets for Italy we were given on the flight were outdated and the ground staff in Heathrow in charge of the boarding procedure did not even know that swab tests were now mandatory for arrivals in Italy when I asked him whether he knew any details of what to expect in Venice. That's fine on the first day after (yet another) update, but this rule had been in place for 4 days on the day I travelled. Overall my experience with BA was very positive though and I am happy to spend a little more on my flight than I would with some cheaper airlines for the great customer service I received."
468,"✅ Trip Verified | I am extremely pleased with British Airways as they refunded my tickets Munich-London City-Munich within 2 working days in a friendly and professional manner: the difference between British Airways and Lufthansa is night and day. Friendly, professional and prompt are 3 adjectives to describe BA, while Lufthansa is best summed up as arrogant, impossible to contact and ignorant. Well Done and Best Wishes to all at British Airways."
469,"✅ Trip Verified |  Boarding and checkin formalities are very nice. Check in help desk was very helpful and supportive. Everything was nice except food. I am vegan and there was no food availability for vegetarian passengers if not pre-ordered. My flight was 10 hour journey from London to Bangalore, and I was hungry."
470,"✅ Trip Verified |  I have always had great flights with British Airways but this time the experience was absolutely amazing! As this was my 100th flight, I decided to celebrate it in Club Europe, which turned out to be a perfect decision. The stewards working in Club made me feel special and delivered a professional and personalised service and were kind and chatty. Although the cabin crew was the best part of the flight, other features didn’t let me down either. Efficient business class check in at Warsaw, cosy executive lounge Preludium with attentive and helpful staff, well organised boarding (although no priority for Club Europe because of Corona). The aircraft was very fresh and clean. Seats were comfortable with enough legroom, adjustable headrests and power ports. The on board service is different than before Corona times but it’s still very good. Tasty lunch box from DO&CO with fresh chicken sandwich, oriental vegetable salad and and amazing chocolate mousse. The choice of drinks was wide, including a very good quality Champagne from Nicolas Feuillatte. All in all a perfect flight experience with British Airways. Everything I expected from this flight was fulfilled. The one thing I can complain about is baggage handling at Heathrow. We waited around 50 mins for luggage and they were also delivered irrespecutful of Club Europe priority."
471,"✅ Trip Verified |  We had a flight to Santorini from LHR at 8:10am. As the flight was full, we had to check in all our luggage. We arrived at the airport at 7:00am, and the queue for check-in was incredibly long because some desks were closed. It took us over 40 minutes to arrive to a desk, and when we arrived we were told that the check-in had closed (at 7:25am) and that we had missed the flight. British Airways staff did not offer us to jump the queue at anytime. The lady at the desk booked us on a flight to Athens instead, telling us that the costs to reach Santorini would be reimbursed. We had to book two tickets worth £200 for a flight to Santorini on the same day. We have just received a response from the Customer Relations service telling us that we would get nothing. "
472,"✅ Trip Verified |  My flight from Los Angeles to Paris via London was delayed due to late inbound aircraft due to mechanical and so I missed my connexion in London and arrived in Paris 3'25"" late and missed my onward connexion on Air France and had to overnight on my own dime in Paris. I applied for compensation lawfully due me through EC261 but their customer relations department refused by carelessly determining that my flight had arrived in London under the 3-hour delay window for compensation even though my final was clearly Paris and their CR agent acknowledged this. After I pointed out the error she ignored me so I filed a claim with the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution and BA sent them a defences. They claim I traveled on AF65 and arrived in London ahead of schedule. The truth is that BA at LAX rebooked and reticketed me on that flight however AF refused to accept me and my baggage unless I paid them a surcharge. So, BA then rebooked me on flights to have me arrive very late into Paris and misconnect and have to overnight there. I do not know which is more shocking that BA would lie to the authorities in order to support their indefensible position or that their agents do not know how to read a passenger name record's air history."
473,"✅ Trip Verified |  I was deeply unimpressed with the lack of social distancing on my flight. The plane to London was 90% or more full, and no social distancing could be applied. A number of people wearing face masks incorrectly (over mouth or as a chinstrap) throughout the flight, and there was a fair amount of time when masks were off for the free snack (small bag of crisps and 250ml of water).  It seems crazy to allow a considerate amount of time with masks off or inappropriately worn in such a small space with no safe distance whatsoever. Also, only the absolute minimum of service which, given COVID, is understandable but makes the flight really boring - or not, since some excitement was provided by turbulence, with very little information from the flight deck. Disembarkation was chaotic to say the least but Terminal 5 was empty and vast enough to allow to finally distance. An upgrade for 89 Euros one was was available but it didn't seem to make sense. At least they departed on time and the plane appeared reasonably clean."
474,"✅ Trip Verified | Newcastle to London Heathrow with British Airways. I was pleasantly surprised. Plane was on time and spotlessly clean. Professional staff; bottle of water, crackers and crisps handed out. Lovely deplaning with special Covid social distancing system working well."
475,"✅ Trip Verified |  Due to the coronavirus situation, I bought a return ticket back to my home country (Singapore) from London (where I currently reside) because the first wave of Asia in March was done. I was due to fly back to London on 25th August 2020 and my flight got cancelled. Before my flight cancellation, I got an email from the airline that I could apply for a voucher if my flight ever got cancelled, so I applied for an online voucher. But I was told that I am not eligible to get a voucher because I have done the London to Singapore leg. A month later, I tried again to redeem for a voucher and somehow I was successful. But to redeem the voucher I have to call to redeem the voucher (which I think it is a complete joke) and I was put on hold for many hours."
476,✅ Trip Verified |  British Airways canceled my flight to London on June 3 due to COVID-19. It is July 23 and they still have not refunded my money. I've reached out to executives after trying the usual customer service path. Nothing has worked. They will not call me and will not provide me any resolution. They are blatantly ignoring emails asking for help. Avoid British Airways. Service is non-existent and they will keep your money. They are keeping almost $3000US of our money.
477,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Frankfurt. I made the mistake of exchanging my April flights with BA for a voucher, because of the travel disruption due to the pandemic. Big mistake. BA has failed completely and does not seem to care. I tried to book an August flight using the voucher, but frlights cannot be booked online using a voucher. You have to wait for hours on the phone to speak to someone. Customer service tried to charge me twice the original cost. Then no email confirmation for hours, after I chased it up (another long wait on hold). Email confirmation showed they had booked the wrong outbound date - service supervisor denied any error on their part and refused to rebook for correct date or give a refund. A few days later I started all over again and booked an alternative outbound date (still not the one I wanted, but better) - And 3 weeks later, BA cancelled the return flight! So I Called for a refund to be told ""If it hasn't appeared in my account after 21 days, to get back in touch"".  Things go wrong. It's how you deal with problems that mark out good customer service. BA hasn't a clue!"
478,"✅ Trip Verified | BA cancelled my flight to Lyon, March/April 2020, because of the Corona crisis. I could not obtain a refund, as the BA website and telephone service made this impossible, it just sent me round in circles. So I opted for a Future Travel Voucher, as this could be obtained via the website. I have now tried to use the voucher for a flight to Munich, and was informed by the website that I have to call BA for this. The Silver card member phone number is inaccessible, as BA has reduced telephone access to one number. I have now called this number five times, each time I was told to call at another time, as 'in these difficult times, they had to protect staff'. This is exactly the same message that I received the many times I called for a refund. Is BA not honouring their voucher system, trying to fob off customers and keep their money? This is appalling business practice!"
479,"✅ Trip Verified |  A short hop from London to Edinburgh in November 2019 - efficient, clean and punctual. The airport experience was straightforward and I think flying from City you get simplicity but miss out on the bigger aircraft which are a bit more comfortable. I got my luggage quickly at the other end and I appreciated having a wide range of flight times to choose from."
480,✅ Trip Verified |  Total rip off. British Airways cancels flights due to Pandemic Covid 19. When i use the voucher they issued me they want me to pay a additional $1000 for a first class seat. British Airways way to rip people off and profit from a world pandemic. 
481,"Not Verified |  I booked flights to Rome from the US and then home through London to LAX in February of this year for the 1st of August. I booked through American Airlines, and then I paid for seat selection for 3 people through the BA website, paying US $951 in total. With the pandemic, it is now impossible for me and my group to travel to Italy and England on this trip as (1) we are not allowed to travel outside the US, (2) as Americans we are not allowed to travel to Italy or England, and (3) the US government has not processed one of the passport renewal we need to fly which was mailed in early February. I had to cancel all of our hotels, AirB&Bs, car and train reservations over the last week in order to qualify to obtain refunds and/or vouchers. I’ve tried to reach British Airways customer service a number of times, finally got through today after an hour on hold. I asked how to obtain a refund or voucher for the business class seat selection that I had paid for and was told that I will lose the money I paid, that there are no refunds or vouchers allowed, because I booked the trip through American Airlines and not through British Airways. My understanding is that BA and AA have a partnership that should make it relatively seamless to book and travel on either or both partners, though I was shocked at having to pay nearly $1000 just to reserve our seats in business class, but this is apparently not the case. I was told that if BA cancels the two flights that we are booked on that I might be able to get either a voucher or a refund. I was prepared today to accept a voucher that I could use when I rebook this trip for 2021, as I understand that BA (and all airlines) are suffering financially as much as I am, but I was not prepared to be totally ripped off by BA. I cannot wait until the first flight is supposed to fly, August 1st, to cancel this as I will lose the money and miles I paid American Airlines for this flight. I am at a loss as to what I can do to handle a situation that is totally out of my control and for which an airline partner that I valued traveling on is refusing to offer a voucher or a refund. I will never again do anything that gives revenue to British Airways."
482,"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked a trip to Spain for mid-March 2020 with American Airlines, British Airways and Iberia. I needed to cancel this flight due to the pandemic and travel ban to Europe that began in March. I was able to change my flight at no cost, which is great, but given the fact that my flight left the day the travel ban began, those tickets should have been refunded. If I were to have boarded that flight, I would have been quarantined in Europe and would have faced a mandatory quarantine upon re-entry to the US IF I were able to return at all. The fact that British Airways did not cancel this flight is beyond me since I do not know who in their right mind would have traveled to Spain with the travel ban enforced. The response I received from British Airways is that it does not matter the reason, unless they cancel the flight, no refund or voucher is available. I'm very disappointed in the response from them during a global pandemic and will not book another flight with them."
483,"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked London to Tel Aviv in Jan 2020, to attend a school reunion. I booked economy. BA then sent me an upgrade offer which i accepted at an additional £500. So I would fly Premium in the new plane. Covid hit and they cancelled the flight. No fault of theirs. Their subsequent behaviour, was all their fault! After a mammoth effort to contact them, i was offered a full refund. This took months and many calls to get, and they deducted £150 as a service fee for the upgrade. Calls and e-mails all result in the same robotic response. As you made a post booking change we are unable to offer a full refund. "
484,"Not Verified |  I booked my honeymoon flight from San Diego to Barcelona in September 2020. I have since needed to cancel this flight due to the pandemic and the uncertainty of travel, especially to other countries. I was able to change my flight at no cost, which is great. However, this is my honeymoon and I paid in advance for seats to ensure I sat next to my would be wife. This was more than $1,000 in additional cost. The response I received from British Airways is that it does not matter the reason, unless they cancel the flight, no refund or voucher is available. I then asked if I wanted to make sure I sat next to my would be wife, they expected me to pay again? The answer was yes. I'm very disappointed in the response from them during a global pandemic, where travel is not safe and we have no idea when it will be safe again."
485,"✅ Trip Verified |  This company is withholding my money after cancelling my flight due to the pandemic and have issued me a voucher. Even though I called to explain why a voucher is useless since we are under a travel bane. Initially, they had said no refunds, the only thing to do was get a voucher. After we had ordered they announce you can get refund if flight is cancelled and you don’t have voucher. "
486,✅ Trip Verified |  Tokyo to London. 12 hours without anything to eat because the sandwich I was given was inedible. There was no bar service and soft drinks were pitiful with orange running out after a matter of hours. Total waste of money having paid for Premium Economy. I am aware it was the beginning of the Covid19 issues but the situation was appalling and has been made worse by a total lack of follow up service from British Airways. Their attitude is unacceptable - it is all about money with them. 
487,✅ Trip Verified |  Flight BA 282 on 11 February was delayed 173 mins due to mechanical in London and so I misconnected at London Heathrow and arrived 3 hrs 25 mins late. I requested compensation and was refused - for three e-mails they told me my flight to London was delayed 173 mins (under the 180 mins floor) and I continued to reply that I did not fly to London but to Paris and arrived 205 mins late. Then they started writing that I was able to make my original connexion which is untrue. I don't know whether to fault their greed at persisting in this lie or their incompetence.
488,"✅ Trip Verified |  London Heathrow to Toronto. My wife and I used Avios and the BA Amex companion voucher to get a very good deal to fly business class on our holiday. I was also excited to fly on an A350 for the first time and it definitely lived up to my expectations. The breakfast buffet in the BA lounge in Heathrow T5 was okay not amazing and there was a good range of drinks and comfortable settees. The aircraft felt very clean and fresh and had good mood lighting, very comfortable spacious seats and large high-resolution IFE screens. I like the moving map but my wife opted for the movies and was impressed with the selection available. We both enjoyed the food and wines on board and it was a professional and friendly service from the cabin crew. The A350 is a lot quieter than older aircraft like the 747 and 777."
489,"✅ Trip Verified |  My wife and I used Avios and my BA Amex companion voucher to get a very good deal for business class flights to our holiday before the coronavirus lockdown was on the horizon. The check-in and security were very efficient and the lounge (not belonging to BA) was clean but had a more limited range of food than I would have expected. Boarding was very quick and cabin crew were friendly and professional. I am a big fan of the iconic 747 but we flew out on one of BA's new A350's and this brought home to me that the 747 business class is looking tired and old in comparison. The seats were comfortable and the food was good but small and very low quality IFE screen was behind the times. However, it was a night flight so I slept most of the journey except when there was moderate turbulence caused by strong tail-winds."
490,"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew with BA recently from Sydney to London, deciding to return back home from travelling due to the coronavirus situation. The first ticket I booked with them was via Hong Kong. After booking, HK closed it's borders so I could no longer get this flight. I rang up BA who advised that the HK flight was not yet cancelled on the system so they couldn't yet book me onto a new flight yet. The customer service agent assured me he would ring me back at 11am the next day as it would be cancelled on the system by then and he would tell me what flight BA would be putting me on as a replacement. 11am came and went the next day and I had not received a phone call. I tried ringing to find out what was going on and was on hold for 5 hours and still no one answered! I decided to book myself onto another flight as there were hardly any left available and I didn't want to end up stuck in Australia. I had not received the promised phone call or even an email to tell me what my replacement flight would be so felt I had no other choice. When I got back home I raised this with BA. They told me that I was supposed to process an 'involuntary change' to get a replacement flight - that is not what the customer agent advised me! I'd never even heard that term before. He simply said BA would sort it out and put me on a replacement flight, he didn't say I had to do anything. So now because I was given the incorrect advice, I am out of pocket by a considerable amount. I raised it with the BA complaints team that I had been advised incorrectly and if I had been told I needed to do an involuntary change myself I would have done so. They were extremely unhelpful and just said that they don't know why I was advised incorrectly and there is nothing they can do about it. When I said that wasn't good enough they basically just fobbed me off and told me to go to a third party adjudicator if I wanted but they were not prepared to do anything.  I will never use this airline again."
491,"✅ Trip Verified |  During the time of Covid-19 it is normal, that a airline has to cancel their flight. I’m ok with that, also when it means that I had to reorganize a few things. What’s definitely is not okay is the compensation via voucher - you can’t use their voucher online or for a cheap flight - on the hotline they offer you no online fare and just way more expensive prices! So stay far away from their voucher. For me as a regular traveler I will avoid BA as much as possible in the future. I even won’t use my miles with BA..."
492,"Not Verified |  Do not accept a British Airways e-Voucher, go for a refund. I stupidly accepted 2 e-vouchers and they are a waste of time. They have no flexibility and despite the fact that BA has money and air miles belonging to me, I cannot redeem the voucher against a more expensive non air miles flight, only an air miles flight that they don't have available at the time and route I want. BA are trying every trick in the book to complicate, frustrate and make rebooking difficult and worse still, you can't redeem the cancelled flight voucher online, only by speaking to the call centre which means hanging on for an hour or so every time you try to 'phone them. I was a loyal Silver Card Executive Club member and still am, but after BA's approach, I will be avoiding them wherever possible in future."
493,"✅ Trip Verified |  London-Heathrow to Warsaw on 14th March. British Airways stands out in many areas of the flight experience, starting from check in and ending on the deplaning. Very friendly, smiling, chatty people throughout my journey, including the lovely captain, who gave all the information about delay, missed slot and new departure time. What is also really appreciated in those coronavirus times, he entered the passenger cabin before takeoff without any mask whatsoever and assured us, this aircraft is so modern and has such good air filters that we are safe here. The boarding procedure was very well organised (no chaos) with 5 groups boarding sequentially. I didn't try the paid Marks&Spencer on board service but I think it would be a nice touch to get some refreshments free. The one thing I can pick on is the cleanliness of the rear toilet. Whilst the rest of the cabin was impeccably clean, the toilet was filthy. "
494,"✅ Trip Verified | Just before the borders were closed in South Africa due to Corona Virus, I went to the Airport to find out if the flight scheduled will fly as planned, there was no international flight customer service staff available so I was not able to get a response, the only number available was a UK number which will cost me more than a flight to enquire. Next day I managed to get on board the flight. Sadly due to my fault, I forgot my laptop inside the Aircraft on arrival to terminal 5. I was one of the last passengers to leave the plane. I realised my mistake after I passed security and I was not allowed back into the Airport to collect my laptop which is fair enough and I understand why I could not go back to the Aircraft. They gave me a number to call and I have been calling the number since March, so far it has been zero positive response because they are using a third party company to help you which has zero interest to help you find your lost items. Basically BA does not have means in place for passengers to find their items. My laptop was left inside the flight hence it is impossible for crew staff and cleaning staff to not find it hence I just can not understand how they can not find it bearing in mind it was 100% left inside the plane. Lessons learned, avoid if you can. "
495,"✅ Trip Verified |  At check-in desk at T5 Heathrow was told by BA staff that Sweden only allowing Swedish nationals into country. This was contrary to advice on Swedish Government website.  I rang the border control office at Arlanda airport. They confirmed that EU/EFTA/EEA & UK nationals were clear to enter the country. I offered the phone to BA staff to clear up any confusion. They declined and then changed their story saying it was their own company policy. I spent the next hour trying to get through to BA on the telephone for a refund. The calls were being disconnect due to high call volumes.  BA standard of service compared to the other major European airlines was dishonest and obstructive. Furthermore if the other airlines can provide customer support on the telephone or via email at this time BA should be able to do the same. While in-flight staff at BA are still terrific, they are let down by the worst sort of management bureaucracy."
496,"Not Verified |  I booked a flight with them on 26 of March, but was unable to flight to the destination due to coronavirus restrictions. Since then I am trying to call them every day! I also filled out the form to request a refund but no reply in a week. Today I finally managed to spoke to the lady on the phone from their CS, but she just directed me to their website or she gave me another number. This number directed me to call again the first number I called already! After minutes of waiting again I spoke to another lady, she asked me for my reference and said she will transfer me to someone else, when she hang up on me!! Unbelievable!! So you can not even call them, and when you finally speak with someone no help at all! I never thought company like this have this poor customer service especially in situation like this with the corona virus."
497,"✅ Trip Verified |  A journey of 2 halves. Before hand, multiple lies and lack of information from the BA website. They cancelled my flight but they weren't honest about what they had done and lied. They claimed that I could re-book and showed lots of flights - none were in fact scheduled to fly but BA claimed that they were full. Then my return booking completely disappeared and the website claimed that ""all journeys complete"". Website at no point gave any indication about how difficult it was getting to fly from the USA to UK. Impossible to get through to BA in London. USA BA much better - a total wait of 1 hour 40 minutes to make 2 calls. Staff at the call centre efficient and helpful. Chaos at Chicago as most passengers had American issued boarding passes for the BA flight to London and BA weren't accepting those boarding passes. No explanation for the change in policy. Everyone I saw merely handed in the American boarding pass and was given a BA boarding pass. On the plane the staff were excellent - as usual. Food was good - verging on very good. Breakfast a little small but tasty. I even got a 2nd cup of tea! Journey smooth with some sleep. I stopped flying BA for 10 years because the head office is so poor - the staff on the ground are good but BA as an organisatiion comes over as badly managed: e.g. over securing client's data, telling passengers what is going on, running a decent frequent flier programme, design of the business cabin (stepping over the legs of the next passenger to go to the loo!) and so on. I only fly BA because of the lack of choice on most routes - whenever there is an alternative I try that (not American Airlines which somehow is consistently poorer than BA)."
498,"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew to Vancouver mid March to see my mother, then in hospital. Three days after arrival my mother passed away and I subsequently needed tochange my return flight to be able to attend her funeral. I tried to manage my booking online, as BA suggest. But, because I had bought a package that included car hire the BA site said I was unable to change this online and I had to call their customer services. I spent over 19 hours hanging on a telephone trying to call the numbers listed online.  I set up conversations Facebook and Twitter, they went unanswered. On the second day of my telephone ordeal I actually called a different number and spoke to a guy in ‘holidays’ who said he couldn’t help me either but that he would try and add me to the queue for the help line. When this was finally answered after another hour and a half of waiting I managed to blurt out my Ref number, nothing else… before that call was disconnected. Thankfully the one person I had briefly spoken to in the Duty office that night then emailed me back and I was able to have a conversation about my need to change flight. This change took about 10-15 minutes over a few emails. But the person helping me couldn’t extend the car hire because the vehicle had already been collected. The only way this could be managed would be by myself calling the car hire company. But two days previously, when I tried to manage my booking online I was told I couldn’t do this because I had bought a package and that this could only be done by BA. I do totally understand the turmoil caused by Covid-19, but never again BA."
499,"Not Verified |  Very disappointed that BA are not making it straightforward to claim a refund on cancelled flights back due to covid-19, effectively holding onto my money illegally. Do what’s right and make it straightforward to do it online. A voucher is not sufficient. Or get more phone operators. The virus is stressful enough without you making to check your site for updates and a 2 hour wait on the phone. Very disappointed - I expect much better from you!"
500,"Not Verified |  I booked my flights to the UK in May 2019 and had to cancel our trip to the UK on March 12, 2020 .. 4 days prior to leaving because a travel ban was going to start on March 16, 2020 and because I am older and have pre-existing health conditions, my doctor asked me to postpone our trip. The British Airways customer care associates I talked with were great and caring and they were able to issue us travel credit for tickets that were non-refundable. Now the problem is, I need to rebook and use the travel credit by May 2020 for travel to the UK by May 2021 or lose all the credit from our trip. How can I make travel arrangements by May 2020 with the coronavirus out of control throughout the world and travel bans in place? I understand BA has policies in place, but I cannot understand how you can expect someone to make travel arrangements while the world is dealing with COVID-19. I feel this timeline is unfair to any consumer who has trust with their preferred airline, my preferred airline is still British Airways. British Airways needs to reevaluate their policies during a world crisis....and make adjustments as needed to be fair to consumers who trust them. Whether a consumer has purchased refundable or non-refundable tickets should not matter, because forcing a consumer to rebook while a world pandemic is happening and not adjusting your policies to the situation can change your loyal customers, remember, there are many other airlines out there to choose from. The coronavirus is something that no one has any control of. I guess the bottom line is I think British Airways needs to put some common sense to their policy. I want to rebook and travel, but I am hesitant to this at this time. Hopefully, May 2020 this pandemic is over for all of us. "
501,"✅ Trip Verified |  Mumbai to London Heathrow. I wish to highly commend the professionalism of the stewards on this flight. Someone had erroneously accused me of being on a flight from Goa to Mumbai and coughing throughout the journey. Categorically I was not on that flight, but in his agitation the passenger could not hear me when I repeatedly said so. The stewards dealt with this situation with tact, absolute professionalism and great courtesy. All the staff must be working in difficult circumstances at the moment. They are putting themselves at more risk than most to ensure that holiday makers and business people can get home safely and I wish to thank our crew in particular for what they did."
502,"✅ Trip Verified |  I have a booking for March 19th, London Heathrow to Valencia, and BA still show this flight as operating and are not providing any refund option. The BA website was updated on 17 March to state ""We’re working closely with the Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO) to continue flying, where travel restrictions allow and where it is safe to do so."" I then checked the FCO website that was also updated on 17 March and it states: ""The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advises against all but essential travel to Spain."" So it is clear that BA deem it ""safe"" to fly to Spain despite the FCO statement. I know the airline is suffering, like the rest of UK industry and business, but how can they get away with such deceitful practices. It is clear they are expecting customers to change their booking to the future and keep the funds, and are not complying with the British FCO advisory. Is this actually legal?"
503,"Not Verified | London Gatwick to Funchal. British Airways are still forcing people to fly to Madeira when the Foreign Office has advised against anything other than essential travel. My wife and her friend were due to fly to Madeira on 17 March for a week's holiday when we found out that the FO had advised against travelling there. The Madeira government had ruled that new arrivals would spend 14 days in quarantine no matter how long their stay, that's a week longer than their proposed stay. Her friend contacted BA but was told they could not have a refund as the flight was still on! They offered a voucher. If this is an example of BAs customer service I am not surprised they are in trouble."
504,"✅ Trip Verified |  Lower Deck Club Class seat, with the current awful, narrow business class facing seats. British Airways premium passengers are treated with indifference at best, and Club Class is simply terrible. My food was not fit for consumption. WIFI broken. Crew morale low. IFE quality a bad joke. To add insult to injury, the  amenity packs are contemptible. What makes BA management think that business people require, (or indeed would retain) a package of socks, mask, plastic pen, and disposable tooth brush? The ongoing decline of this once-great national airline is palpable. "
505,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to New York JFK. Another grim flight with British Airways in Club Class, on a tired and old B747-400. The Business Class at BA is by far the worst in the industry. The dreaded ying / yang configuration is going to be with us for some time, sadly. In flight entertainment with tiny screen, no HD, and poor movie selection. WIFI did not work, as usual. Food continues to be desperately poor, and crew were rather keen to disappear quickly. This airline needs major overhaul, and investment in new aircraft and seats."
506,Not Verified |  Diabolical that British Airways are still forcing people to fly to Madrid when other airlines have cancelled their flights and the Foreign Office have advised against anything other than essential travel. What a way to treat their customers. If that is how they are going to treat people it is hardly surprising they are in trouble.
507,"✅ Trip Verified |  Frankfurt to Buenos Aires via London in October 2019. The aircraft is very old with small screens and ample entertainment, which becomes an issue flying +10hrs. The 1 hour layover was a complete disaster. The staff was unfriendly and inconsiderate to me. "
508,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Paris return group booking cancelled. I know the current coronavirus is causing problems for any airline, but BA appears as usual to have no contingency plans to handle extra number of enquiries and it is proving impossible to speak with them. After the constant IT debacles this airline has, surely it is time for heads at the top to roll? Cancelled my booking for flight refund online, but they do not return the seat booking fee and you have to do this afterwards. However, the manage booking page wipes all preferences to your booked seat numbers and you cannot complete the form without this information. A 5 year old child could improve upon the user unfriendly app and website that BA currently has, and my patience of being loyal to BA (for over 40 years I might add) has run out. The management of this airline appear to live in a conceited bubble and have no idea what is going on at the front line."
509,"✅ Trip Verified |  London City to Berlin on 8th March. Flight got canceled. The lady at the counter was extremely unfriendly and arrogant. Extremely rude staff and service. This is no way to treat passengers!, especially not if the expensive flight is cancelled!"
510,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Beijing in January 2020. BA has really upped their game now. A few years back I took BA, the experience was really disappointed and avoid them since However, my recent flight is good. The flight was delayed for 1 hour due to mechanical reasons, but get back majority of the delay in the air. Food is tasty, and crews are not hesitate to provide more if you are still hungry. The drinks are offered in the promote manner, and crews are really willing to engage with you (in the gallery when majority of the passengers fall asleep). Seat is a bit tight but understood I am flying economy so this is bearable The return flight has been cancelled, it takes like 10 calls / emails, and they finally sorted out our flight. This could be improved but I appreciate it is not easy to change you to an airline which is not BA's partner Overall, BA has really improved the game, and the friendly and professional crews are the best in the world"
511,✅ Trip Verified |  Hong Kong to London. Great airline indeed! Staff were friendly and helpful! The aircraft was very clean. The crews are diverse. Will definitely fly again.
512,"✅ Trip Verified |  Mumbai to London. The check in process was quick, efficient and friendly. Unfortunately there was a two hour delay on departure, but BA kept us informed and we were given a free food and drink offering from the food court. Information, explanation and apology over the delay was given by the first officer which we were happy with. The entertainment screens were a little temperamental to begin with but they eventually worked. Good service and friendly attitude from the cabin crew made the long flight easier though. Very happy with the service."
513,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Delhi. This booking was part of a holiday group format so we had to check in as opposed to bag drop. According to the check in screen, all zones were applicable for our destination, but we were sent from one zone to the next; (which, given the size of the T5 check in hall wasn't helpful) Eventually, we managed to find assistance but it was very much a shrug of the shoulder attitude - especially when we discovered we were seated separately; it was only when a family with two young children had been split up that we were able to switch seats. Fortunately, the cabin crew made up for this by providing a fabulous flight, with great service and positive, friendly attitude. I actually praised them and told them that my faith in BA had been restored!"
514,"✅ Trip Verified | Paris to London. Flight cancelled due to “ATC Restrictions” after Storm Ciara  and rebooked to a later flight which was delayed on top by 2 hours. Arrived in London 6 hours later than planned initially and BA refused to recognise any additional expenses because it was a forceful operational reason. Booked 3 flights to Italy for March, all cancelled. Last Thursday booked LGW/BGY/LGW and next day cancelled (for last week of March) a month away. Been a Gold Member of BA since 2016 and after seeing their constant downgrades, I will go back with AirFrance/KLM for my travel needs. AI found thr food and seats on Euro Business a shame."
515,"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew from Sydney to London to visit my seriously ill mother. The second leg, from Singapore to London was with British Airways. My return flight from London to Sydney was with British Airways, leaving 23 February. On 20 February it became clear that Mum did not have long to live. I contacted BA, who said I should be able to change my return date, and asked me to send medical documentation, which I did, with an explanatory email. Sadly Mum passed away very early on the morning of 22 February. I contacted BA again the next day. They said because I had booked through Webjet, I needed to contact them. I phoned them, they said they would contact BA. No follow up from either. When I phoned Webjet again, they said still no word from BA. When I phoned BA again, they said they couldn't help. At this point I gave up and booked with Qantas, paying for another flight. BA's complete lack of compassion (apart from a couple of platitudes), and lack of interest in helping me in any way, astounded me. Needless to say, I will never use British Airways again."
516,"Not Verified |  Gatwick to Malaga. Nothing special, nowadays there's unfortunately not much difference between BA & Easyjet. Flight left Gatwick late & arrived in Malaga late. BA seats no longer recline. Food and drinks are expensive, their Cream Tea excludes tea. Lift your game BA, your product just continues to get worse."
517,"✅ Trip Verified |  Vancouver to London. There are time when British Airways deserve to be ranked as one of the very best carriers. This flight proves the point. From the warm welcome at the door on boarding until deplaning at LHR, the crew were outstanding. Friendly, attentive and professional. The dinner was excellent. Excellent choices on the menu, accompanied by some decent wines. I had a painful back from running. A flight attendant provided some medication, came back to my seat an hour or so later to check on me and remembered to ask me if the pain had subsided when I deplaned. Very thoughtful. Seat was comfortable and complemented by a proper cushion and a very nice quilted blanket. IFE good. The B747-400 is showing its age but it’s still a wonderful, iconic aircraft to fly on and I’ll continue to prefer it over the B777. "
518,"✅ Trip Verified |  I am flying London to Seattle in Business Class in May 2020, and British Airways wants around £100 each way for me to choose seats. All other airlines I have encountered allow Business Class passengers to choose seats at no additional cost. They decided to change my seat ""for operational reasons""s. What could that reason be? The plane is the same. So, BA takes £100 off me for me so that I can choose my seat and then changes my seat - without asking me. What I get is an automated message (the next time I log on to the BA website) to tell me. There is a number I can ring, 40 minutes waiting for the phone to be answered and I give up. "
519,"✅ Trip Verified |  London Heathrow to Nairobi. BA First is so much weaker than that of Middle Eastern and Asian airlines, I despair. The brightest spot of this trip was being able to use the CX lounge at Heathrow T3. To cram 14 first-class seats onto a 777 is quite an achievement. But it is the food that is the standout problem on board. It is poor and it is shameful that our flag-carrier represents Britain so badly in this regards. Conversely, the flight attendants were excellent in both directions. I only flew First because BA's business class is so poor. But never again."
520,"✅ Trip Verified |  Dubai to London. My husband and I traveled together. He got business class, my ticket was a last minute add-on, so was Premium Economy instead. After we boarded, my husband came to me to give me his pillow, so I got settled and started sleeping. I was woken up by a flight attendant who grabbed the pillow that my husband gave me and saying that, There is a lady in business class is missing a pillow, did I take the pillow. I told her I didn’t, and the pillow was given to me. I stood up and told her it wasn’t Ok for her to accuse me of stealing a pillow, and I’ll show her whom my husband is who gave me the pillow. I located my husband in the business class, apparently, his seat had 1 extra pillow and so he gave me the extra one. He offered to give his pillow to the flight attendant who said there was no need and he could keep it."
521,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Cape Town. Gone are the days in which British Airways was a great airline. Weird seat configuration, service that needs training, horrible food and no internet in business class are  basic services offered by most of the airlines but not by BA."
522,"Not Verified |  Rio de Janeiro to London . Economy - packed out seating, awful food, very narrow seats, uncomfortable, expensive add ons (seat choice, luggage), try to match Norwegian pricing on the Rio route, IFE was iffy. My back and legs have been terrible for 3 days (I paid £77 for an exit seat), the breakfast served was unfit for me, I took my own drinks and some food items. Long haul is getting the same as short. Come prepared!"
523,"✅ Trip Verified |  Johannesburg to Dublin via London. I get to the counter and require a transit visa. Since when and why if you are in the same terminal even. There was no support, guidance or remorse from the staff. I also had a non refundable hotel booking in Dublin! BA need to communicate such changes."
524,"✅ Trip Verified |  Las Vegas to Paris via London. The staff were great, but the 747 was the most uncomfortable flight in business class I’ve experienced.  The aisle seat felt like I was sitting in the aisle, a business class configuration of 2-4-2. That’s a tight squeeze. And,there were backward facing seats. The seats were not only uncomfortable but just so many things wrong with the configuration. I was just glad I didn’t pay full price for this flight."
525,"✅ Trip Verified |  BA cancelled my return flight on 09-Feb-20 from Geneva to Gatwick due to storm Ciara. They rebooked me onto a later flight, then cancelled that as well. Since then, I heard nothing more and I was left on my own to buy a new return flight. I've tried calling them several times every day, but they are not answering their phones, claiming they are too busy to talk to customers. They cancelled my flight, so I want a refund, but so far there is no way of getting through to them. "
526,"✅ Trip Verified |  Mexico City to Manchester via London. My plane from Mexico City to London was smooth. Entertainment was quite nice and so was the food; although I chose a window seat and was never informed it wasn't actually the window, but a wall! The crew was amazingly kind and lovely. They're always checking on you, and we even got a Magnum! Loved this airline for my first flight ever."
527,"✅ Trip Verified | London Heathrow to Sofia. A good experience onboard one of BAs recently refreshed A321 cabins, although unfortunately without any in-seat power supply, contrary to what is stated on their website about which aircraft types were due to get in-seat power following refresh. Another thing to add to the list of inconsistencies with the BA product. However the flight overall was very good. As usual an extremely efficient pre-flight experience at Heathrow's excellent T5. Fast track security was fast, as expected. Galleries Club Lounge was pretty good, and not too crowded. Boarding was smooth with priority boarding honoured as usual. The crew were excellent and provided a very attentive service, with plently of drinks runs given the slightly longer distance of the flight. The food pretty good for a shorthaul business class offering. I found the seats to be pretty comfortable and legroom reasonable for a 5 ft 11"" chap. So overall a good experience with no major complaints."
528,"✅ Trip Verified |  I was to fly to Melbourne from Manchester via London and Singapore in July 2019. Arriving late to board my Heathrow flight, the Check-In-Staff discussed my dilemma with her supervisor. Only option being to find my way to Heathrow. I somehow managed to get to Heathrow in time where only the Singapore to Melbourne Boarding Pass was issued. I was told that because Manchester to Heathrow flight was missed, my Heathrow to Singapore was cancelled. "
529,"✅ Trip Verified |  Madrid to London. I keep giving BA the benefit of the doubt, but things are getting worse not better. This A321 has cramped business class seats, no middle table any more and frankly this is a pathetic premium cabin. Despite every statement they make about catering improvements, i simply refer to meal photos on this route in 2016 or 2017 to see they have severely cut back on meal portions and cost. Iberia staff in  Madrid were all very nice, cabin staff okay, but overall Club Europe is not worth the money - don't waste your money on this.  "
530,"✅ Trip Verified |  Prague to London. This is the first time I have flown with British Airways. The flight departed earlier than intended and got to Heathrow about 5 minutes early. However at Heathrow, there was a plane in the way as we had arrived early. A negative was at the check-in, partly the website’s fault, as we had done the online check in. We selected the amount of bags we each had. It said we would have to pay extra, and we spent forever at the checkin because we had to pay £65 for each bag. Apart from those negatives and the delay, I would definitely fly this airline again."
531,"✅ Trip Verified |  Johannesburg to London. Whoever designed the refurbished Galleries Lounge at JNB has no understanding of acoustics, as every syllable of a Facetime conversation was audible 20 feet away. Add in different languages and some degree of inebriation as you have a recipe for an unrelaxing experience. Thankfully, the upper deck of the A380 was more civilised, with an efficient, if slightly distant, cabin crew who ensured that everyone was fed and watered by 2 hours after takeoff, allowing plenty of time for sleep. Food was mediocre and I've given up expecting anything more from BA's business class product. The White Company bedding is more of a gimmick than a genuine enhancement, and breakfast has become rather perfunctory, with no pastries or bread apart from a solitary croissant. Arrival at a chilly LHR was ahead of schedule and we were curbside 30 minutes after landing. Reliability is currently BA's strongest card."
532,"✅ Trip Verified |  Las Vegas to Gatwick. A very disappointing service for Club World, it felt like I was travelling in economy (with attitude). Especially considering the very high cost of the flight (I've paid half as much less for business class returns to Australia). We got off to a bad start when offered one third of a glass of champagne (about 2 cm in the bottom of the glass). My initial drink after take off was not what I ordered, when I queried it, I got a lecture on this was how it should be. No wine arrived with dinner, until I asked for it a second time (out of stock of the first choice), no second glass of wine offered. Yes, I could have used the call button, but 1/3 of a glass of champagne and one glass of wine being offered on a 10 hour business class flight? Other than the initial bottle of water, and a glass of water with dinner, no other water was offered until I got up and went to the galley to ask. The good news is the food was good and well presented. Although the promised (on the menu) selection of pastries with breakfast were not served (I later walked past the galley to see the crew eating them for their own breakfast). We had dutifully filled in the pre-order card for breakfast, only to find we were being asked again at breakfast. Sleeping was impossible due to the temperature being so high, I actually thought I had a fever (I was so drenched in sweat) until I spoke to a colleague who was the same. I'm used to flying ultra long haul with Middle Eastern airlines, so I'm used to hot cabins, but this was crazy. Only when the crew dropped the temperature a few hours before landing (presumably to wake us up), was it bearable enough to sleep. Combined with the a very dry cabin air, it was very unpleasant. No need to say anything much about the eight across seating as I know the seats are being upgraded over the next few years, other than they are very cramped if sitting next to a window. I do like the semi-reclined position for take off and landing though. I have fairly big shoulders and found the seat width very restrictive. There is nowhere to put your spectacles or bottles of water if lying down. Being on the second aisle, we had to join in with the economy passengers queuing to disembark, so it wasn't quick. At no point did any member of the cabin crew introduce themselves other than via a general PA announcement. The seats I can forgive as they are being addressed, but the service was budget airline level. Really BA, you need to do much, much better. The ground staff in Las Vegas were fast, friendly and efficient. The lounge was something from the dark ages, all 1970's wooden panels."
533,"✅ Trip Verified |  San Diego to Stockholm via London. Had I written this review immediately on landing it would have been zero out of ten. But I realise this would be unfair- BA is a game of two halves. The inflight experience is immeasurably improved from a few years ago. The food in Club is excellent, the cabin crew attentive and professional, the pilots are the best in the industry and IFE absolutely fine. The Club World product is competitive with the better European airlines such as Lufthansa and streets ahead of most US carriers. The problems start when anything goes wrong - which it frequently does given the mostly old fleet especially on non-core routes. In my case, the flight was cancelled due to the inbound aircraft (an ancient 747) going technical. Then a comedy of errors. First the hotel vouchers just said ‘Holiday Inn’. There are about 15 in San Diego- cue hordes of passengers looking for shuttle buses in the wrong place, arriving at hotels with no booking etc etc. Next, the replacement flights. The clunky app kept just saying error for some reason. Eventually the full website on a PC showed my replacement flights. But no booking refs or any statement if these were being offered to me, were confirmed or whatever. On calling BA they wouldn’t talk to me because I ‘failed’ security- I didn’t know the billing address of the specific booking which was done by my company’s travel department despite having a full executive club account that was associated with the booking and which they could have used. The next day I went to take the replacement flights- Alaska Airlines to Newark then SAS to Stockholm. Despite getting a boarding card and making it to my seat on the plane, I was pulled off minutes before takeoff. BA had not paid for the flight! A reservation had been created but no ticket issued. BA then booked me on a roundabout route back via Chicago plus a 12 hour layover from 4am to 4pm, getting me home over 36 hours after my original reservation. Later I spotted that the next BA flight which would get me home much sooner now had tickets available online, why was I not on this? When I called they had no explanation and only agreed to ‘exceptionally’ change my flight again after I complained about all of the above. Finally, I arrived home after a 24 hour delay and a roller coaster of incompetence. In summary, when all goes well, BA is better than it was and staff are doing a heroic inflight job. But old planes, rubbish back office IT infrastructure and plain incompetence mean this airline can be hell if anything goes wrong. And bear in mind I was travelling in business class- who knows how they treat economy passengers."
534,"Not Verified |  Cape Town to Johannesburg. The SLOW lounge at Cape Town continues to impress by the standard of service and the generous array of food and drink, including ingenious wine-dispensing machines. Boarding was quick and take-off was exactly on time. There was some turbulence but the captain kept passengers well informed. The Club meal was the usual offering with the hot options displayed on a tray. Arrival was 20 minutes ahead of schedule."
535,"✅ Trip Verified | On 4th of December before my flight's departure I got my purse stolen in NYC with all my money and my passport in it. Thanks to the kind strangers I managed to get to the Danish embassy and get a temporary passport. When I arrived at the JFK Airport it was too late and I wasn't allowed to drop off my luggage. With tears in my eyes I went to the desk where they sell tickets and the employee was so kind and helpful - she booked me on to the next flight for free, got me through security without having to wait in the line and she informed the flight crew what happened. When I finally sat down the flight crew were so kind and gave me water and food as I haven't had any food for the whole day as I didn't have any money. I want to say thank you for your service and kindness and for making sure that I got back to Denmark safely. I was overwhelmed with all the kindness from all the staff! Once again thank you!"
536,"✅ Trip Verified |  Phoenix to London. Since moving to the USA I've been flying BA more than in the past and overall, they provide a more than acceptable service. If you choose your seat in Club World carefully and the crew are in the right mood then they surpass expectations. The new menus and service offering are significantly better than in the past and the wine list more interesting. On this flight the crew were engaging and the food was good. Departed PHX early and arrived into LHR early where immigration and baggage took minutes. If you manage your expectations with BA, then you won't be disappointed with Club World."
537,"✅ Trip Verified | London Heathrow to Bangkok. Done this route a few times with British Airways over the years, first time and probably last in economy, old plane needs upgrade, poor entertainment system. Uncomfortable seats especially for 10+ hour flight. I know they’re starting to upgrade these planes but still a long time away. The only saving grace was a superb cabin staff in economy."
538,"✅ Trip Verified |  Mumbai to Boston via London. My flight with British airways was really good. The catering was excellent on both flights and even the service was good. However, some of the seats have very limited legroom due to the IFE box blocking space in front of you. Also, BA had misplaced my tennis racket which was checked in. They have a really weird policy that you can't carry your single sports equipment as cabin baggage and instead, you have to check it in. The ground staff was rude at Logan Airport in Boston. Also, they took a week to deliver my racket to my house even though it arrived in Boston 24 hrs after I had come. Even after contacting BA'S Baggage Customer Service, they were speaking rudely to me. They always tried to cut my call in like 2 minutes without even listening to my concern. British Airways needs to improve their ground experience. "
539,"✅ Trip Verified | I purchased roundtrip tickets for my wife and I to travel from Orlando, Florida to Accra, Ghana and I purchased advance seat assignments. Unfortunately, British Airways only gave me the seats I paid for for one of four international legs our our roundtrip. I have been fighting with British Airways to get my refund for these seat assignments. They have only provided me with refund of $234. Despite several phone calls and filing multiple on-line calls and providing them with detailed, my fightcontinues. Their customer service is really poor. I will never purchase advance seat assignments with them again."
540,"✅ Trip Verified |  Toronto to Geneva via London. I stopped flying BA about three years ago after they dramatically downgraded their service. Apparently things have improved somewhat since, so I decided to give them another try. Overall, I was happy with my experience, save for two major gripes. On the plus side: I flew on new aircraft, which were comfortable, albeit with the usual narrow seats for modern aircraft (same with all airlines). Legroom on the 787-9 was generous and seemed to be more than the official 31"". Pilots were very good and informative, as always with BA. Quality of food on long-haul has definitely improved since the bad old days of soggy pasta and droopy sandwiches; I rather enjoyed the meals served, which were on nice large trays. The IFE was just about adequate, though surprisingly dated for such new aircraft. Cathay Pacific's is far superior. The two major downsides: 1. The new Basic Economy fare. It is really pesky and serves only to disgruntle passengers. BA really need to get rid of it. Virtually everyone on long-haul has to check in a bag, so please just include it in all airfare types. If I wanted to be nickle-and-dimed, I'd fly to Gatwick on a charter airline. Also, not being able to choose a seat even at the time of check-in is infuriating. I was automatically allocated a middle seat even though the entire rear half of the plane was empty! This just goes to show that you will get a middle seat unless you pay. Thankfully, the lady at check-in changed it to a window seat free of charge after I asked nicely. 2. No complimentary catering on short-haul. Seeing as virtually all passengers flying to/from Heathrow are connecting to/from long-haul flights with BA and have spent at least $1,000 on their airfare, I resented a drink and snack not being included on the short-haul segment of my trip. BA should not be treating connecting passengers the same as those on low-cost airlines who only paid a few dollars for a short trip. If BA would get rid of these two new features, I would not hesitate to fly with them again, as everything else about my trip was pleasant. As it is, I would still consider other airlines."
541,"✅ Trip Verified | Hong Kong to London Heathrow with British Airways. One of the best flights I’ve had in a premium cabin. The service, seat, food and wine are among the best I’ve experienced. The only gripe I had was the cabin temperature which was quite warm and sleeping was quite impossible at first even with pyjamas on provided by BA. The cabin attendant did my own bed and it was a nice touch. I would not hesitate flying First class with BA on my next flight."
542,"✅ Trip Verified |  San Jose to Amsterdam via London. Layout of Boeing 787 cabin is poor with rearmost seat not having luggage bins (row 42-44 D, E, and F,). In addition the crew fill the bins over the outer seats (row 42-43 K, J) with their bags and blankets. I would not recommend BA or the 787."
543,"✅ Trip Verified |  Singapore to Paris via London. The flight was a ok, dated seating with shakey arms not the most comfortable but a serviceable experience. However our luggage was not loaded onto the flight, the second time this happened now with BA and despite a 13 hour flight, 2 hour stopover, and 1 hour flight to Paris BA did not make any effort to inform us at any time of the issue. Instead after travelling for around 17 hours we had to wait for the baggage to all come and clear before we realised ours was missing. Being a Sunday and most shops close at lunchtime that also left little time to buy emergency items and the despite knowing they hadn’t loaded the baggage they could not find a way to send it quicker than 24 hours after arrival meaning 2 out of 3 days in Paris will be spent without luggage."
544,"✅ Trip Verified |  Warsaw to London. Everything went like clockwork and nothing could be disliked about this flight. Professional crew with beams on their faces, new aircraft (it's important to choose a seat no further than row 14 in A321neo, as those seats are the old type Pinnacle seats and have better legroom), very informative captain who told us about expected turbulence before we had taken off (very much appreciated), on time landing and good atmosphere on board! The food in Euro Traveller is unfortunately no longer free, however being in BA's Executive Club you can pay for the food & drinks with avios, which is very convenient. The only drawback I could find is a long queue to the bag check-in at Warsaw Airport - 3 opened check-in counters for approx. 200 people is rather not enough."
545,"Not Verified |  New York  to London Heathrow. Very good, staff very nice, comfortable seats, seat recline good enough, food a bit limited. I would recommend BA to others since they are a very good airline."
546,"Not Verified |  London to Los Angeles. Take off was delayed by 3 hrs (which we spent onboard) because of a dent to the door which needed inspection - sure maybe outside of their control. I was flying with my wife and two kids (2 & 4), sitting on bulkhead with 3 seats and using the baby bassinet facility. After take off we saw that the inflight entertainment service (for the whole section - not whole cabin) was not working. And we were sitting into an 11.5hr overnight flight with two little ones, meaning sleeping was not going to happen. We contacted the cabin crew who made zero accommodation. Sorry they said. During the flight the cabin crew stood in the galley behind the bulkhead talking loudly while the lights were dimmed, and kept slamming drawers as they moved things around. To cap it off, we landed at 10pm ET and they had left behind our baby car seat and stroller. We finally received them back 2 days later. Conclusion, never fly BA again."
547,"Not Verified |  British Airways (Comair) Johannesburg to Cape Town route is never less than fully subscribed, and on this occasion the equivalent of Club Europe stretched back 9 rows. Service followed the usual pattern of a drink (champagne included) and Comair’s idiosyncratic ‘four-course meal’, I.e. a tiny salad, a hot course that one could see before choosing, a minute iced cake and a minuscule cheese & biscuits. The hot meal is invariably scorched around the edges. Comair really need to move with the times to a more modern business class offering. Aside from the meal, the flight was typically efficient, with arrival slightly ahead of schedule."
548,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Bangkok. It's not what it used to be but most importantly, it does not deliver what it promises any longer.  Disappointing food, outdated and uncomfortable seats, appalling baggage handling at LHR, and  mediocre crew service onboard. The customer service online is just as bad. My most recent experience was early January 2020 when they put me next to a couple with a newborn baby in Club World on an overnight flight from LHR to BKK. Baby screams, could not sleep and as the cabin was full, they could not move me. The couple was very nice, apologetic and we just had to bear the 12 hours long haul flight together. However, my dealings with customer service was appalling. When is BA going to offer a kids free zone in Club World for people who need to work or sleep?"
549,"Not Verified |  London to Johannesburg. Departure was slightly delayed by 50 mph gusts, but once away  the flight was the usual comfortable experience on the upper deck. Seats 53J/K are some of the best as long as the galley is quiet. The dinner service was efficient and we were ready for sleep after a film. Cabin crew were pleasant and attentive. Toilets were kept clean throughout the flight. Arrival was 30 minutes behind time, but baggage collection and customs were mercifully quick, so we were in the SLOW lounge just 40 minutes after landing. Overall, a good flight."
550,"✅ Trip Verified |  Overall a very comfortable flight with British Airways. Both of my flights took off on time and reached on time. I was really excited to fly BA since they changed the aircraft from Boeing 777-200 to a Boeing 747-400 which is known as the queen of the skies.  The flight attendants are very nice and professional towards passengers, they did their best to speed up the boarding process since both of my flights were full and we took off. Everything went well on my first flight and also flight time went short over the atlantic due to great tail winds. On my second flight to Mumbai, the flight attendants were polite and respectful and gave the best service. However, during the lunch service, they ran out of vegetarian food option and had to fetch for vegetarian food in other cabins and even give crew meals to passengers who were vegetarian. Overall, my both flights with BA were good. There are some shortcomings on their older fleet like lack of USB ports, Power Outlet, Old IFE, the IFE box in front of you that blocks your legroom.  BA  need to refurbish their old cabins on Boeing 777-200 and Boeing 747,if they still plan to use them on longer flights."
551,"✅ Trip Verified |  Los Angeles to London on 6th January, and my husbands seat was broken. The Customer Service Manager was rude to me and made insinuations about our intentions. It was a dreadful way to end our honeymoon and left a bitter taste. A truly horrendous experience."
552,✅ Trip Verified |  Gatwick to Cancun. Flight was late. My food was bad and it was not possible to change. I paid for the internet which did not work for me most of the time. Was advised to report but no instructions to where or how.
553,"✅ Trip Verified | 
Fantastic flight. Travelled solo from London Gatwick to Glasgow in British Airway’s Club Europe cabin and could not fault one aspect of the service. I arrived at Gatwick around 2 hours prior to departure. All BA Club World passengers are entitled to fast track security at Gatwick. This was quick and the staff were pleasant enough. The lounge at Gatwick was clean and modern and made for a nice relaxing start to the journey. Boarding was quick and the flight departed on-time and landed 10 minutes early, the crew were very attentive and friendly. The in-flight meal was delicious (I had smoked Salmon served with curried rice). Overall a really lovely flying experience. Had there been ever-so-slightly more leg room and in-flight entertainment I’d have given this flight 10/10! A fantastic crew who were a credit to the airline."
554,"✅ Trip Verified |  Rio De Janeiro to London Heathrow. Love this aircraft, only a 3 Class, Business, World Traveller Plus and Economy Class. 2 Cabins in Business class Front 3 rows and Rear 2 Rows. I had seat 3A, In my opinion the seat, Window seat with a bit more space than the usual seat (at 6'4'' a little extra helps) very private tucked behind second galley area, toilet is over the other side J/K. I settled in to sleep and did not have an evening meal. Crew very accommodating as they offered water bottles immediately. A good few hours sleep as normal and woke up about 10 minutes before breakfast. I really enjoyed the fruit, yoghurt, muesli and the full English Breakfast. All in all great service, Good flight and felt fully relaxed."
555,"✅ Trip Verified |  Gatwick to Tirana. I was incredibly disappointed by the service provided on this flight, because it was virtually impossible for me to differentiate what made this flight different from being in economy. Business class passengers boarded at the same time as economy class passengers, there was no curtain dividing economy class from business class, and the people in economy class had taken the liberty of removing my cabin bag from my space above my seat, to three seats behind me. . The seats were the same seats you have in economy, the difference being that the middle seat is empty, thus creating a divide between window and aisle seats.  I encountered odd problems with the meal as well - the lovely cabin crew member notified me that I had no other choice but to eat pasta for dinner because other choices had finished. You are better off in economy as you pay less and get the same service. Flight left on time and landed early. British Airways have in my opinion the  best inflight W-Fi service. For 10 pounds you get unlimited, very high speed wi-fi where you can stream YouTube videos. They offer cheaper packages as well where you can get unlimited texts."
556,"Not Verified | Keflavik to London Heathrow. Cabin crew were amazing. Weather was terrifying as we drove to the airport so we knew things were going to be tough. Expecting a delay and seeing other European flights were cancelled we expected the same but then were surprised to see our flight boarding. Snow in blizzard conditions, we were surprised but got settled in our seats. Crew very friendly and a long story short after 3 hours on the ground waiting for the di-icing machine we finally made our way to take off. All the staff were so relaxed and calm with all passengers including those who had connecting flights they sat with each one and personally looked at their options the BA online app to help them. Non-alcoholic drinks and snacks were provided during this time. The first officer kept us informed all the time that is was not BA fault that the de-icing machine was delayed so much eventually procedures done we were ready for take-off. How the pilot and team managed this in these conditions I will never now but it was a smooth take off an when through the clouds a smooth journey all the way back to Heathrow. Cabin crew provided excellent service. Being business we were lucky to have champagne and our meals were excellent. Veg shepherds pie and chicken curry both lovely. So just want to thank you BA. We know you get a lot of negative reviews but this is to say we can't fault you. Particularly the crew who made a real effort to talk to all of us. Well done."
557,"Not Verified |  Fly economy and you’ll be paying more for an awful service. The London to Vancouver route uses old planes, the oldest inflight entertainment systems and my food was inedible. "
558,✅ Trip Verified | My partner and I spent Christmas in Tokyo. The flight over was enjoyable the staff were polite and helpful and it all ran smoothly. Our experience back home was completely different. The staff were incredibly rude and lazy. The flight was 12 hours and mid flight my partner asked for a bottle of water. The lady very rudely said she was going the other way and that my partner could head to the back and help herself. My partner headed to the back where there were two more ladies sitting and when requested they pointed to a shelf my partner got the water from. Both our TV's stopped working mid flight also for a period of 40 minutes. We asked the staff if they could fix the problem. The lady said she would try while sighing. As 25 year olds deciding on which airline brands to remain loyal to I can tell you British Airways will not be it. Terrible customer service.
559,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Hong Kong. At the entrance to the BA business lounge there was a sign saying Silver and Gold members only. My membership had just dropped to bronze while my wife's remained at silver. At the reception desk I asked why bronze wasn't allowed and was only told I could enter as a guest of my wife's. When I got to the entrance we showed our boarding passes and I can only assume the lady must have overheard our previous conversation as my wife was asked if she was bringing me in as her guest. No warm greeting, just a job's worth high handed attitude. Neither of the BA reps bothered to check my boarding pass properly. Had they done so they would have seen that it was a business class ticket and I had the right to enter under my own steam anyway. Fortunately the cabin staff were friendly and much nicer."
560,"Not Verified |  Los Angeles to London Heathrow. If I could give BA a zero stars I would. They have the worst customer service. I’ve flown many airlines around the world with my family, but surely we will never fly with British Airways again. They gave our seats away on the return flight and would not address this after purchasing expensive business class tickets 4.5 months in advance to ensure that our family flew 12 hour flight together. The flight to London didn’t have the best service, most toilets were out of service. The beds in business class are the most uncomfortable of all business class I’ve flown. The check-in process at Heathrow was disastrous. The most inefficient process with no human assistances. The limited ones available were all slammed with line of customers. I would highly suggest you refrain from using this carrier. I wish I would have done a bit of research prior to flying with them."
561,"✅ Trip Verified |  Istanbul to London. We had to wait for ages to check into our flight after being advised to turn up 3 hrs before departure time to check in. We had to wait for 40 minutes before any check in staff turned up. Once they did, the staff were surly and rude. On the flight and there was no IFE, no free drink or snack or  a map to track the flight. The onboard crew were a bit chaotic. Serving M&S food for purchase. The flight was not delayed by too much and relatively smooth. However the BA product is now tired and slightly pathetic. "
562,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Bucharest. On my flight the hot food finished half way through - I was seated on row 22 and by the time the food cart reached my row, there were no sandwiches left to purchase. The fitting of the cabin was horrendous. Seat change from one row to the other 24h before take off cost me an additional 13 gbp. "
563,"✅ Trip Verified |  London Heathrow to Rio De Janeiro. Not the usual aircraft for this route but it is one of my favourites, this aircraft today has a First Class but was flown empty as it usually only offers Club World. Flight not full, Seated in 7F aisle seat, no one in the middle seat so very pleasant. It is away from the Toilet over at 7A/B but next to galley area which was great as it is a day flight. Food (pre-ordered) was very good as usual, plenty of drinks offered crew very keen to assist, again nothing any trouble at all. I did watch some films but I had already been on a previous BA Long Haul so was not really looking for much. I had some rest as it was a long day and I getting a cold! Arrived late due to a technical problem at Heathrow, they managed to fix the problem on the taxiway to the runway but after an hour I must say I didn't really need to be told they were trying to fix the problem rather than return to the departure gate. All in all another very good flight."
564,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Athens. The aircraft and the flight quality were good, but they don't provide free food and drink. It was unacceptable they did not have sufficient supply for goods they were selling, so it ended quickly."
565,"✅ Trip Verified |  Copenhagen to London. Super slow, had to wait for buses which were delayed. Also packed the buses to tight with people. Where too far from arrival terminals. Service bad from staff. Coming to Terminal 5 is the worst terminal on Heathrow. The food and beverage on board was terrible for the price. For the price of the airline ticket the whole experience was way below expected service and time of staff."
566,"✅ Trip Verified |  Budapest to Billund return via London on 18 and 28 Dec. 2019. A320 aircrafts. Check-In in Budapest had a narrow timeslot of 2 hours before departure with long queues. I was not recognised as Oneworld elite flyer (hold a Gold Card with Qatar Airways) at check-in and had to struggle to get 2 bags accepted as inscribed luggage. I was denied lounge access as QR does not honour 3rd party lounges any more unless flying on QR. There is no Oneworld  lounge in Budapest, so BA uses Menzies Lounge who would not accept me unless I was with an entitled Oneworld card different from Qatar Airways. For BA I do not have status. In London granted access to any Oneworld lounge. Onboard, food and drinks with hefty price tags,  water is not free. Flights were full, but on time. I found that the onboard charity collection by FAs is inappropriate and intrusive. Luggage delivered perfectly. Return trips (2 legs) were both full flights but departed slightly early. Granted lounge access in Billund in the decent King Amlet and BA Galleries First in T3 in London. Loads of good, hot foods and good beers and wines. Onboard there is no IFE, no seat recline. Mediocre, not cheap. But the FFP is among the best in Oneworld and the gold status of BA is very rewarding."
567,Not Verified |  I recently flew from Cape Town in South Africa via London to Brussels. It was our anniversary and we were treated to a glass of bubbly after take off. The staff were so friendly and I cannot even complain about the food served on board. Which I might add I seldom enjoy food served on flights.
568,"Not Verified |  Sydney to Toulouse via Singapore / London. Boeing 777 and IFE ancient, the comfort and service superb. Highlight on the TLS-LHR sector a (£5.50) celebratory treat with mince pie, christmas cake, brandy butter which combined with a G&T hit the spot. You could argue it should be free but I’m not complaining.  I do miss the BA quality of service, but compared to the ME airlines you’re still pretty good."
569,"✅ Trip Verified |  Sofia to London. A good overall experience. Departure experience let down by poor airport lounge in Sofia, and complete failure to honour priority boarding. Flight experience generally good, and arrival experience at Heathrow very good and efficient."
570,"✅ Trip Verified |  My husband and I had a wonderful flight to Barbados the cabin crew were very friendly and nothing was too much trouble.

Tank you, your staff are amazing we will be British Airways in the future, many thanks."
571,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Munich BA956 on 21 December, delayed by 25 mins. Dated not very clean A320. Boarding process was slow and asking passengers to check their hand luggage.

572,"✅ Trip Verified |  Hong Kong to London. I booked a return ticket for my sister though BA, provided travel document details they required. However when we got to the airport we found out my sisters middle name was not on her ticket and it therefore didn't match her passport name. They refused to let her fly, after much hassle and my sister getting a temporary visa, they enable her to fly. However, once landing in London I acknowledged that she may have the same problem flying back to Taiwan. Igot in contact with BAs' executive phone helpline service, yet spending a day speaking to them they have only caused me to speak to numerous different people all telling me to do different things. We have still not resolved the issue of her ticket not having her middle name on. BA are refusing to alter the ticket information to add my sisters middle name onto the ticket. They have not been helpful on the phone when i asked them to add her middle name and are not interested in try to solve the issue at hand. They were insistent on speaking to my sister who is from Taiwan and I told them she is unable to speak english and that i can translate any question for her. They did not allow this so she was put on the phone however they only spoke English to her."
573,"✅ Trip Verified |  My husband and I used British Airways to fly from London to Paris this past August. When we arrived at airport we needed to pay for bags, was charged 4 times for one bag after I was assured charges didn't go through. Have been trying to get a refund from BA since. They give you a phone number to call for these claims only to never answer the phone! They have you do a claim online only to never respond to your emails. I sent them the bank statements and credit card statement showing that I had been charged 4 times for one bag. Only 2 months later did they finally respond to the claim, claiming I had two bags and despite the fact that I sent documentation showing 4 charges and confirmed with bank and credit card that the charges had gone through, they only saw two charges and since I had two bags they didn't owe me any money. They force you to communicate via email and then don't respond they owe me $258 USD and refuse to give me my money at this point. "
574,"✅ Trip Verified |  New York to London. I was on the last flight out at 11.35 pm and this is clearly the cheaper version in all respects.  The Boeing 777 certainly showed its age. IFE screen was tiny, seat was well used. The flight time was quick (5.50 hours) and thats about it. FA is highly professional to the point of being unfriendly to me. The F& B was standard and not taken as I had eaten something earlier. I'm a One World Emerald and the cabin manager did not greet me. Its a small touch and in the grand scheme of things means little but is an acknowledgement that you spend time and money with that carrier (usually followed by a drink or two). "
575,"✅ Trip Verified |  Austin to London. Along with an $1900 purchase price for each of two roundtrip tickets for my wife and daughter, BA charged an additional $250 for seat reservations to ensure they sat together. When they went to check in, those seat reservations (in both directions) had been given away and family had to sit in different seats. Back home, I applied for a refund of the $250 seat fee and was told there was no proof I paid for them. I have credit card charges and email confirmations clearly stating these charges were made, but there is no process to upload those documents to BA."
576,Not Verified |  Frankfurt to London with British Airways. Awful airline. Put me and my wife at opposite ends of the plane even though we booked together. Gave me middle seat even though many others were free. A childish airline which charges a premium and then goes out to make the journey difficult for you if you don't book biz class. Avoid.
577,✅ Trip Verified |  London to Glasgow with British Airways. Flight is again delayed it’s not like it’s a one off as it’s delayed every week like a bad joke. Really a poor yet very expensive airline who I wouldn’t recommend to any traveller.
578,"✅ Trip Verified | London to San Francisco. This flight was a delight. Friendly, relaxed crew, good food and wine and a main deck Club World cabin that was nearly empty. If you manage your expectations with BA Club World and everything goes as it should then you shouldn't be disappointed. Yes the rollout of the new Club World Suite has been a long time coming however the food service has improved considerably - BA are trying valiantly to regain their long gone moniker of ""World's Favourite Airline"". The 747 has seen better days however given they're being removed from most airline's passenger services, you should take the opportunity to fly one before they're gone. I'm gradually regaining my confidence in BA."
579,Not Verified |  Heathrow to Belfast. Great service in Belfast but absolutely shocking in T5 at Heathrow. Very rude check in staff when told we had to print out boarding passes and also for our suitcases. Totally disgusted. Cabin crew were lovely on the 12.40 flight to Belfast on 9th December.
580,"Not Verified |  London to Singapore. I was apprehensive about flying BA Club World after reading many negative reviews. I was however, surprised. Firstly, they are not on part with SQ or QR - but to be fair, I found them to be one of the most reasonably priced offerings. You get what you pay for. The seat while old, is perfectly comfortable with plenty of space. The window seats are best for privacy. I am tall and had no issues sleeping. In fact, I slept for almost 7 hours. The service and food out of London was top notch, fresh and plentiful, which is a welcome contrast to the tiny meals you receive on Qantas. Service was consistent, polite and very attentive. Drinks and water continually topped up. I was truly impressed The return flight's service was very average and quite sloppy but let’s focus on the positives!"
581,"✅ Trip Verified | Toulouse to London. I'm a able bodied, fit BA customer and Silver member and was seated at an Emergency Exit seat. I'd put away all items and had fastened my seatbelt in full compliance of regultions. A cabin crew member, came to my row to point out the security exit and safety card and I was listening to him and responding, despite this he ordered me to take out my cabin pressure equalizers, which he called earplugs. I explained to him that I needed to keep them on to protect my ears as the doors were already closed and I can suffer from ear problems when I fly. I told him I could hear him perfectly, as demonstrated by our vocal exchange. Despite this, he kept talking over me and threatened to remove me from my seat should I fail to follow his order. After I begrudgingly took them off, he once again ordered me to do it or be removed from my seat and I pointed out I already had! I then asked to speak to the purser, who came to see me after take off. I told him his cabin crew member was unnecessarily rude and needed Customer Care training or indeed to look for a new job. I wrote in to British Airways with my complaint, but they have not even bothered to respond. Awful, rude airline."
582,✅ Trip Verified |  London Heathrow to Stockholm. Business class short-haul is what it is. Seats are the same as in economy but with no one sitting in the middle seat. But you get served drinks and food. Proper gin for the G&T and good food.
583,"✅ Trip Verified |  Johannesburg to London. We had limited recline seats on an 11 hour overnight flight. At checked in we asked and were told we had good seats. Completed a complaint and asked why BA thought this was ok, how come their representatives are allowed to lie. Never flying BA again."
584,"✅ Trip Verified |  Johannesburg to London. The recently refurbished First and Club World lounge at JNB has failed to resolve the congestion when passengers from the two evening flights to LHR descend on it. There's more table space for eating and the food has improved, but poor acoustics mean intrusion on privacy. Crying babies and facetime calls add to the restless maelstrom of human activity. Boarding was reasonably quick although there was the usual confusion about group queues. The predominantly young, mixed fleet crew were competent but lacked finesse and kept on getting drinks orders muddled. The meal service took ages because of some unidentified problem with heating the main course. The food itself wasn't at all bad - when it was finally served. The cabin temperature wasn't too hot and we both slept quite well. Arrival was ten minutes ahead of schedule and baggage collection was quick. Overall, a good flight despite the aged Club World product."
585,"✅ Trip Verified |  London Heathrow to Miami. Flying the Boeing 747-400. Unfortunately BA hasn't done much work on their first class on these aircraft. Seats are flat bed but you have that wedge in the front that even for my 6'1"" makes the beds small. And since it's so narrow your feet get clamped if you sleep on your side. These seats are Business class on for example Qatar Airways. And I still think a first class ticket should include WiFi! But as always the service excel and the crew are so friendly and helpful. Meals are impeccable."
586,✅ Trip Verified |  Stockholm to London Heathrow. As always BA works excellent with service. On the ground and in the air. They still have a good gin aboard for a decent G&T and even if the meals in Business looks like the came from the 90's economy they taste great.
587,"Not Verified | London to Sydney via Singapore. Flight left on time cabin crew where fantastic. Meals were great. Leaving London we had a chicken stir fry and landing into Singapore at 18:00 we were served an English breakfast which I can eat any time of day but wife thought it was a bit odd. At Singapore, all passengers had to disembark the aircraft while it was refuelled and clean. When re-boarding you had to go through a security check at the gate. We were on the ground in Singapore for 1hour 30min. 2nd leg to Sydney was great also food and drink service was great again. 23 hours long haul flight was comfortable. We had exit row seating for entire flight which I recommend to anyone over 6ft tall."
588,"✅ Trip Verified | London to New York JFK. We were booked on Brussels Airlines, two of us, which cancelled the flight and rerouted us on BA. The flight BRU to London was fine but the transatlantic leg and Heathrow Airport Terminal 5 were utter nightmares. Never again will I go to or through Heathrow. However, this review is about BA's 747-400 to JFK an aircraft that was in such a sorry state that it should have been junked years ago. How does BA have the gall to call its service ""business class""? The seats were tiny and wrapped in plastic chicken coop partitions that rattled and even fell down on several occasions. Let me add that we faced backwards and looked at a filthy wall. Cabin service was friendly and the food was actually quite decent. Aside from that, I now understand why BA has such a horrendous and well-deserved reputation. Never again."
589,"✅ Trip Verified |  The first thing is the shortage of staff. The business cabin is quite large and eight across and seem to be serviced by one or two people each side. It meant that the drink after takeoff did not appear for an hour after the order was taken. Unfortunately although they were pleasant, the staff were not up to the mark and appeared very undertrained. I asked a young man to turn on the reading light and he claimed there weren't any. I showed him the one by my seat and after fiddling with it he said it must be broken. At the end of the flight I discovered the switch. Despite being a newly configured plane the dividing screen kept dropping. I had to ask for a cup of tea 3 times. There was only a choice of two reds and two white wines and considering the number of people in the business section I cannot understand why they  would not offer a third. There was Port on the menu but was never offered with cheese. Every time the next course came out the setting was not ready to accept it due to plates and glasses from previous course. Many people had clutter uncleared for an hour after end of meal. Most of the courses were quite small portions and by the end of the meal I was ready for a mini snack. I am not a big eater but I was peckish. The layout of the business cabin is cramped. I am 6' and I could not stretch out. The seats and legroom are extremely narrow and people in the centre two rows and the window seats have to climb over other passengers. This means no one has a easy seat. You either have to climb or be climbed over. I wonder how they can expect such a bad design to be accepted in the business market. I travel on many airlines in business and BA is still the bottom of the pile and reluctantly the last one I would use. The centre and window seats have their food and drinks served effectively through the service hatch across other customers. Unfortunately, upon arrival at Bridgetown the BA team didn't get any better. After one hour 25 minutes of waiting for my fast tracked luggage I approached a guy wearing a BA tabard and he just shrugged his shoulders. I then found another guy who worked for the ground staff and he went outside and found about 25 cases sitting by the tarmac doing nothing. "
590,"✅ Trip Verified |  Brussels to Bangkok via London. Club World from London to Bangkok on 17 Nov 2019, seats 15C and 15D. It was a Boeing 777, with a 2-4-2 seat configuration in the business cabin, which gives the cabin a crowded impression. The seats are comfortable, with a flat bed (+mattress!), good selection of entertainment, although a rather small screen. The food menu offers different choices of starters, main course and desserts. The food was disappointing, I had smoked salmon as a starter, and British Beef as main course. My soup was cold, mybeef was overcooked) and quantity was economy class-like. The service is very friendly, but not personal. I’m used to be adressed by my name when I fly business class.  While serving the meals, they forget serving me wine. The amount of cabin crew is not enough for a crowded business class cabin. After dinner I went to sleep. The seat is turned into a real bed, with an extra mattress and a good pillow. The space is narrow, it is difficult to make the bed. Once the bed is made, there is no place to put  personal stuff. I had a real good night of sleep though. If your seat is not at the aisle, you have to step over someones legs to go to the toilet. The toilets are small and simple, not cleaned frequently enough. When I woke up, breakfast service was running.  The breakfast is good.  Yoghurt, pastries, fresh fruit, and a full English Breakfast. Overall, British Airways World Club is a rather standard Business Class, lacks personalized attention and lacks the feel good experience.  If BA wants to compete, they have a long way to go. I hope they can make it up a bit on our return flight."
591,"✅ Trip Verified |  San Francisco to Oslo via London. The head support was damaged, so I had to sit 10 hours leaned forward. The flight from San Francisco was delayed, so I missed my connecting flight in London to Oslo. I came first to the BA counter, but received a new flight 3 hours 15 minutes later. Rude staff gave me a voucher for 15 GBP. "
592,"✅ Trip Verified |  I had a connection flight from London to Berlin, traveling with hand luggage. I got through a automatic boarding gate and the man at the gate said that I need to check my baggage.  He has no right to grab my passport and boarding pass. If the flight is full they should check overhead lockers if there arent any things which should be put under seats and where can fits more hand luggage. The flight arrived in Berlin 7 minutes late."
593,"Not Verified |  London to Johannesburg with British Airways. BA’s B gates lounge is a rather more civilised place to pass time than the Galleries Lounges in the main terminal. It’s also a tad closer on the transit - or via the rather useful walkway on level -4 - to the C gates where the A380s depart from. The new boarding by groups meant snaking queues, but at least group 2 moved fairly speedily. The Club World were still the same, much maligned seats with the small, unresponsive IFE screens and limited selection of films. The dinner service was slow because of the unwise introduction of individual trays brought to each seat. Trolleys may lack glamour, but one does get off to sleep quicker on an overnight flight. Breakfast was adequate but nothing more. Landing was exactly on time. Overall, a reasonable flight but the inflight service was distinctly average."
594,✅ Trip Verified |  London to Bangalore. The flight from Bangalore to London on 10 November 2019 was delayed by 4 hours that resulted in me missing the connection flight. My return from London to Bangalore was initially delayed by 1.5 hrs. We were assigned a boarding gate and after waiting at the gate for 30 mins announcement was made the flight was delayed 4hrs 27mins due to maintenance. 
595,"Not Verified | London to Sydney via Singapore. I would like to express my thanks and appreciation to the staff at the bag drop centre at Heathrow when I lost my passport on Thursday evening -21st November. They spent nearly 2 hours trying to locate it and it was eventually found 30 mins before my flight was due to leave. A big thank you to you all. I would also like to thank the cabin crew on flight BA0015-Singapore to Sydney -22 November who were so kind after I was taken ill during the flight, I was looked after so well."
596,"✅ Trip Verified |  Lisbon to London. I pay extra to check my bag, to ensure I am not using more than my share of overhead space. To have British Airways charge me 50 Euros to check a bag to my final destination, and then insist that my briefcase be put under the seat, in a cramped aircraft, to ensure there is room in the overhead bin for travelers too cheap to check their bags, is an insult. Will never fly BA again."
597,"Not Verified |  BA operate daily shuttles from London to Glasgow, its a busy route and I'm sure make money plus there is no competition. However, BA flights are rarely on time and the fee paying passenger's are fed stories about the aircraft was delayed en-route from some far flung exotic location. Because I have several buses and trains to catch after I reach Glasgow punctuality means a lot to me and not a lot to BA hence I'm very disappointed with the service they provide."
598,"✅ Trip Verified |  Doha to London. Surprisingly good flight, ontime departure and early arrival by 30min, very very attentive and friendly crew, especially towards children. Food was halal since from Doha, clearly announced to passengers. Bag arrival was ok. Seat leg room and entertainment beyond my expectation."
599,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Buenos Aires. We paid extra on top of our holiday cost to fly with them as it was a direct flight. Firstly they cancelled our flight a few months before departure, meaning we had to go a day earlier and pay an extra night in a hotel. The plane was old and cramped, making it difficult to get up and walk around during the 14 hour flight. The entertainment system was pathetic. Not much film choice, a random selection of tv programmes, and no games. The drinks service was lacking, my food was awful and there were no snacks offered in between. On other long haul flights we have had comfort packs with toothbrush/toothpaste etc, no such offerings."
600,"✅ Trip Verified |  San Francisco to London. A380 is a wonderful aeroplane. Movie selection was below average. Staff were polite. Fist time I used the call button mid-flight response was fast, but on second occasion I was repeatedly ignored call button for 45 minutes. I don’t see how that is acceptable."
601,"✅ Trip Verified | Sydney to Singapore with British Airways. Packed in like sardines in a tin can. What a disappointment of an airline. They pack you in, and even getting to your seat is a debacle due to the cramped nature of the flight configuration. You awkwardly stare at your fellow guests who sit right opposite you trying not to lock gaze. My seat was so close to the aisle that at times it felt like people were walking over me to get past (very narrow passage ways). Would not and could not recommended this airline. These seats are at best premium economy."
602,"✅ Trip Verified | London to Mauritius. We are fortunate enough to have flown with many different airlines including low cost carriers and also upper class cabins on other premium airlines. Without a shadow of a doubt, the whole British Airways experience is the poorest of them all both with the aeroplanes and seats, the general service and experience but more importantly the poor customer service following the bad flight. I truly feel that this airline deserves to go bust because of the truly disgraceful approach to service and the product they deliver. I begrudge flying with them and given the option I always choose a different airline."
603,"✅ Trip Verified |  Los Angeles to Amsterdam via London. Due to delayed take off I risked missing my connecting flight. Thanks to the excellent premium host service, Julie and her colleague, I managed to be on time! Thank you very much."
604,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Vancouver. I used to fly this aircraft and route for many years until it was no longer priced competitively. I flew on the 14th and it was a remarkably bad experience. Food service was very poor in most aspects. I had the chicken tandoori which was far too spicy for most palettes. No drink was offered with the meal which was astonishing. Rather, tea and coffee an obviously far cheaper offering was supplied soon after the dinner tray was handed. I had to ask twice for a beer before it was delivered.This then put me out of sync with the service. The one time (yes one time!) offer of tea and coffee was then obviously missed by me completely. Service itself was not good with no warmth or hospitality. On a 9hr flight engagement is pretty critical! Our hostess/host seemed to be only interested in those sitting in the extra legroom seats and essentially ignored everyone else. The cold snack was a cold tasteless sandwich just prior to landing. The entertainment system is a joke as it is so old. I had become so accustomed to a normal/newish TV screen that I was blown away that this system was still in place. The screen size was the equivalent of your phone’s. No music selection worth talking about so I just used my iPad. On this or similar routes I have flown Air Canada, WestJet, Virgin Atlantic, Air Transat. BA was by far the worst and some of those airlines are budget in nature and offer paid meals only. I cannot believe that the mighty BA offers such a terrible product in 2019. I will spend more to fly better and actively avoid BA on long haul."
605,"✅ Trip Verified | The flight departure was delayed due to what the Captain described in his announcement as a ""mix up"" with paperwork. Disembarkation was delayed due to what he also described as a ""mix up"" with landing bridge allocation. So the plane had to taxi around the runway until a gate was found. We missed our connecting flight. The staff in purple at the airport who are supposed to help passengers find connecting flights didn’t know what to do. We ended up being shunted onto another flight resulting in a four hour delay. All of this inconvenience is due to BA’s incompetent management. My seat would not recline and the food was just carbohydrate filigree. The flight attendants are rude. It used to be a good airline."
606,✅ Trip Verified | London Heathrow to Lisbon. Mediocre. The flight was very smooth and arrived on time. Cabin service left a great deal to be desired and staff seemed to be just going through the motions. No bread roll was offered during meal service and despite requesting a glass of wine to accompany the meal this was not forthcoming and staff required a ‘nudge’ before it was delivered. Not a great Club Europe experience.
607,Not Verified | London to Boston. Comfortable flight in economy class. Food was fairly good both ways - dinner for the evening flight west and the returning night flight east. Got some solid sleep in on the flight back.
608,"✅ Trip Verified | Tirana to London Gatwick. I fly British Airways around six times a month thanks to my work, and while I almost always have a pleasant experience, this past flight definitely outdid all the others. We boarded and departed exactly on time, with a very friendly and welcoming crew. While the flight was fully booked, my travel companion and I were lucky that no one was sitting on our row so that we could have an empty middle seat, and therefore more space. The best surprise of this flight by far was the availability of Wi-Fi which I have never had on any other British Airways flight within Europe. In fact, the Wi-Fi package I got which included only texting, was unlimited and incredibly fast - as good as my home connection! This truly made this flight more enjoyable as it allowed me to continue my business even during the flight which is extremely valuable to me. Something that British Airways can improve on would be leg space, which in this flight I noticed was particularly tight, although that is a common problem for me as I am 1.88 cm tall. Also, for unknown reasons, no food or snacks were served on this 2 hours 45 minute flight, only drinks. This was a slight struggle as I had skipped breakfast, but I managed well. The flight however arrived ahead of schedule and we de-boarded quickly. I always recommend BA - and will continue to do so."
609,✅ Trip Verified |  Gatwick to St Lucia. Great service on this flight. Thank you very much for the cabin and the great cabin crew. Excellent Service.
610,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Singapore. I have to commend BA staff on this occasion. They were friendly, welcoming and so accommodating to passengers throughout the flight. Even in the last few moments they were laughing and joking with us. Highly professional and sensitive to our needs despite their own tiredness. Thank you BA for making a long journey a tolerable one. "
611,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to San Francisco return in Economy. The seats are small. Outbound was bearable because there was an empty seat between the two of us but returning no empty seat and it was horrible. I'm only 5'5 and female but couldn't lean down to the seat in front of me to collect my belongings. If you want to get anything from your bag below the seat in front of you, you will need to do some major maneuvering. Touching the person next to you throughout the flight is unavoidable. I flew on a 747 both ways. They no longer have any air vents you can adjust so both flights got stuffy and warm. I had to ask them to turn up the a/c both ways. I was literally sweating. Economy is small with the aircraft mostly made up of Business Class. Asian Vegetarian meal was good as usual although the breakfast was terrible. Asian Vegetarian breakfast in Economy Plus is much better. I will find an alternative airline for my long haul flights. It's not worth it."
612,"Not Verified |  Gatwick to Venice. We have flown this route and class on two occasions and been pleased with all aspects. On the recent trip we both had mobility issues and the check in operator immediately suggested their assistance service. It was welcome and efficient, particularly as the gate was a very distant one. The flight departed to time. The cabin staff were pleasant, the food was good. In flight information from the flight deck was good. The landings were noticeably smooth. The return journey was similarly good. I was very satisfied."
613,"✅ Trip Verified |  Bordeaux to Gatwick. British Airways cancelled my September 11 flight due to the pilots strike, with advance notice. I made alternative travel arrangements, confirmed that I wanted to to cancel from my end in order to receive a refund, and received confirmation from BA on 24 August 2019. BA refunded my fare soon enough, but I am still awaiting a refund for the 70 Euro cost of baggage that I paid - six weeks later. I lodged a complaint on 9th October. No action. I lodged another complaint on 25th October, and still no action. They cancelled my flight, and won't refund my money. And they call it Customer Service! "
614,"✅ Trip Verified |  Seychelles to London. Day time flight back to London. Staff were very welcoming greeted on entry to aircraft and shown to seats 7 J/K, Best seats as a couple to book as they are away from the toilet in the front cabin and the window K seat has direct access to the aisle. On-time departure and swift meal services, nothing was any trouble at all and the flight was full. Easy access to the club kitchen after meal service and great entertainment, I have found this flight great and love the inbound day time flight to London the easiest to travel on. Seat and screens worked great and no problems. I loved every minute of the flight. A big thank you to all the staff who were fantastic. Looking forward to my next flight to Rio in December"
615,"✅ Trip Verified | London to Belfast. British Airways bullied my parents and spoilt a special occasion. I booked my parents on BA to attend my investiture at the Palace. My mother had a heart attack 3 months ago and this was her first flight post recovery and I had chosen BA expecting the best level of service. Instead they were treated appallingly and felt bullied by the airline staff. My mother suffers from claustrophobia and always requests an aisle seat and I booked my parents on 2 aisle seats side by side. I printed their boarding passes out myself with seats 24c and 24d. On arrival at check-in, one of the boarding passes was not recognised by the scanner so assistance printed out a new one. On going through security the boarding pass was again not recognised and a new pass was printed. Once my parents arrived at the gate they noticed that one of the seats had been changed. My father explained the situation but the rep at check-in started quoting the ‘Geneva convention’ that BA are only contracted to get them from A to B and could change seats if they wanted. Waiting at the gate to try and resolve the situation and eventually with 5 minutes before airborne they were rushed into the aircraft and forced to sit apart with no care for their welfare or circumstances. At no stage did they receive any apologetic words. For someone recovering from a heart attack, this was an unnecessary stressful event and spoilt what had been a special family occasion. I have been holding on with the hope that BAs slide from grace will halt but seem to be constantly disappointed. I will await BAs response to my parents; I know they will not fly the carrier again but I will be handing back my BA Amex and all points if an appropriate apology is not issued. Will update! In summary, don’t trust BA with your loved ones care."
616,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Cape Town. We had booked business class tickets a year in advance for a trip to Africa. I usually fly Star Alliance, but picked BA for a segment for better connection timing through London to Cape Town. This was a huge mistake. I had tried to reserve seats on BA website twice and was not able to do so. Then I tried to call BA twice and gave up after being on hold for an hour each time with no call back option. When we arrived today in London from Toronto at the connections desk, seven hours before our flight, we were told that business class was oversold and we would be downgraded to premium economy. BA’s representative told us that because we did not have reserved seats, we were at the bottom of the list for business class, and that loyalty customers would all have priority for seats over us, but we would still be welcome in the lounge, (as if this was a bonus). Then there was a problem for us to clear security to get to the lounge, since they could not print our boarding passes (due to the down grade). It took close to an hour to get settled into the lounge from the time we first arrived at the connecting desk. We asked to speak to a manager, but at each of our four interactions with BA staff we were told that they would get some to speak with us, giving the impression that they were trying to pass off unhappy customers as fast as they could. At one point I got visibly frustrated after the BA staff issuing our new boarding passes indicated that our down grade was voluntary, which it definitely was not! After two and a half hours BA customer service managers came to speak with us. They were the first ones who were actually apologetic and tried to address the situation from a customer oriented perspective. If British Airways think giving bulkhead seats in premium economy and basic lounge access to paying business class passengers is adequate customer service for a downgrade from a paid business fare on our upcoming overnight flight, I will not be booking flights on BA again."
617,"✅ Trip Verified |  San Jose to London. The TV screen of 12F was broken, could not be locked into position that would allow to watch movies. Flight attendants could not fix it, and suggested to move to a different seat which we slipped on purpose while checked in. The back of the seat in front was dirty. The tray on the 12D where I was moved to, had a hole on the right side, and the TV screen was not sensitive enough to be be operated by touch. Although my husband in 12E and me turned in the breakfast cards together, the flight attendant insisted they don’t have it, and was not planning to wake him up and serve him breakfast.  Flight attendants were doing their best, but it seems that they were understaffed."
618,"✅ Trip Verified | London Heathrow to Edinburgh. Boarding efficient. Flight was full so passengers asked to volunteer to check in hand luggage. By doing so they would get priority boarding. I took up the offer, too out my laptop and carried it on to the plane. The aircraft is only two months old and I was sat at the back of the plane - 36 F. I am sure Ryanair have more room. British Airways on this aircraft are offering an ultra low cost service under a cloak of legacy carrier legitimacy."
619,✅ Trip Verified |  Flight from Gatwick to Barbados. Check in and business lounge were good. It looks like they had added champagne to the self service drinks which is a positive. Breakfast was good. Flight left on time boarding well run. I have not flown in their economy cabin for a while and it seems ok. New configuration but that does come with Panasonic IFE system which is way better than the old Rockwell Collins systems. Food was fine and service friendly.
620,"✅ Trip Verified |  We were not supposed to be on this flight but had been bumped from our Icelandair flight and rebooked onto BA direct from Toronto to London Heathrow. We tried to get it changed as we were supposed to fly into Gatwick. The flight was quite good. Service was fantastic, and the chicken tikka masala was tasty. The crew onboard was friendly, flight was on time, and landing was amazingly smooth."
621,"✅ Trip Verified |  I was travelling from Jeddah to London with a bag. I arrive 1 hour 30 minutes earlier but the check in counter was closed, I tried my best but there was no staff to help me so I have to leave my bag as I was not allowed to take the bag on the plane. In London I made a complaint but they were saying that we can’t do any thing and to get through to customer service the phone call takes about 1 hour and 47 minutes of wait"
622,"Not Verified |  Zurich to London return. Both legs travelled with hand luggage only, and I could not choose a seat without paying. Fair enough but when there are 3 empty rows either side of 3 strangers cramped into one row and not allowed spread out as they had not paid the premium price seems mean to say the least. Hand Luggage fares are last to board, make them uncomfortable on board, no free food nor drink."
623,✅ Trip Verified |  San Francisco to London. Efficient check in by friendly agent who offered an upgrade to First at $760 per person which we declined. Refurbished lounge was spacious and comfortable with nice selection of snacks. Boarding on time but could have been better controlled. Flight left and landed ahead of schedule. Flight attendants were excellent and the food is vastly improved compared to our last trip. Business Class is not cheap but we had an excellent flight with no complaints.
624,✅ Trip Verified | London to Belfast. Check in was fast and efficient and using the BA Terminal-5 First Class check in and security area was really good and I was straight into the lounge. Great selection of food and drinks early morning. I really like the BA boarding process i.e.by Group numbers. The onboard service and quality of breakfast served was excellent. Overall very happy with this short flight with BA.
625,"Not Verified |  London Gatwick to Salzburg with British Airways. Worst customer experience I have ever had after cancelled flights due to strike action, no response and when we did it was weeks between getting answers only to be told it's not their fault and would not pay towards cost of changing flights back home."
626,"✅ Trip Verified |  Frankfurt to London. Flight attendants very kind when flying in. Return flight was canceled at London City Airport and it took almost three hours to get rebooking, hotel voucher and transportation arranged. That could be done far more efficiently. No water, nothing, no necessities."
627,"✅ Trip Verified |  Hyderabad to San Francisco via London. I had an awesome experience with one of customer service representatives at British Airways. I called them with regards to a reimbursement and was put across a lady named Florencia. She not only helped gather all details (bank, address etc) required for payment but also initiated the payment instantly. That was certainly over and beyond what I expected. Great job! Your service is exemplary."
628,"✅ Trip Verified |  Vancouver to London. Very poor experience my flight with BA. the 2-4-2 business is not nice as much as crowded as economical class. One toilet closed (nobody around to repair ?). on one point BA even better than asian companies. its even more freezing. why do we need to freeze in such a 9 hours trip ? no staff to answer my question. no staff to make it better. one good point, the seat are surprisingly comfortable but easy to make it better."
629,"✅ Trip Verified | London to Malaga. A terminally ill airline packed with clueless staff full of attitude. At the checking at Gatwick airport, I was told the flight might well be delayed of 2h as not departed yet from Malaga. SMS confirmed the delay without a new time of departure and provided a link for flight status. At Gatwick, there are no arrival/departure boards prior to security for me to check if the flight was on time as shown online. When asked the BA guy at the lounge kiosk, he said I could check the link provided or go through security where monitors are. Surprisingly the flight was on time and no text was sent for an update. At the gate, we were told the aircraft was replaced. No apologies from anyone neither ground nor on the flight. We boarded at 5 pm and took off at 18:15. Stiff and no recliner seats. Cabin crew are so sociopathic and full of attitudes. 6 additional seats are replacing the 2 toilets located at the back of the 320 and located at the very far end of the aircraft in the cabin crew storage room and working space is. Horrible low cost service for a flag carrier ticket price."
630,✅ Trip Verified |  Brussels to London. We were not given a seat number upon check in and were left waiting outside the gate for the boarding passes to be re printed without any explanation. Everyone else with a boarding pass was boarding whilst about 50% were just looking at the operators thinking what is going on. Extremely poor communication from the airline to and from the airport operators. 
631,"✅ Trip Verified |  My flight from London to Singapore in premium economy was the worst I have experienced. The seat was uncomfortable, the flight tracker failed after two hours, the breakfast prior to arrival in Singapore (scrambled egg) was like rubber. They ran out of cups and so my wife and I had no coffee, tea or drink with our breakfast. I used the call button to get some attention and no one came to answer my call even after waiting more than 30 minutes. Eventually I made contact with a passing cabin crew member and advised that we had not had a drink and was told that they would come back. I never saw the crew member again. "
632,"✅ Trip Verified |  Kuala Lumpur to Glasgow via London. The service started, first some drinks. On my aisle was a female attendant and a young male attendant.  I asked for an ale, the attendant pretended not to understand what I was asking for. I repeated many times the word ale with my Spanish accent, but she still did not catch it. The male attendant said “like an IPA”, I answered “yes”.  I changed to a beer and she offered me Amstel or Heineken, I chose Amstel and had to ask for ice  to make it drinkable. When the service was finished the female attendant collected the empty bottles and cans and glasses but skipped me. For the meal I chose the beef and asked for a beer. The male attendant realized that the empty can was still there, took it. With the food on my and no drinks I started to eat, after ten minutes it was obvious that the beer was not coming, so I stopped another attendant going to Business class and he came back with an option of Tiger or Heineken lager. The female attendant offered me coffee but she did not mention it was normal coffee and in the menu it said that decaf was available if you specifically request that. ABreakfast I was offered tea or coffee (even decaf), I accepted, but there was no milk or cream for me."
633,"✅ Trip Verified | London Heathrow to Seychelles. Really great flight, boarding was very quick, the flight was full, seats great 07 A/B Good inflight entertainment, plenty of choices. Food was good as we already pre-ordered our meals, my beef was well done just how I like it. After a late 30 minute delay we landed on time into Seychelles, the crew were very attentive, lots of very demanding passengers. All in all, a good flight after 7 hours of sleep"
634,"✅ Trip Verified |  Edinburgh to London Heathrow. I have no problems with any of the flight crew or service while flying, everything on the plane was fine. After the flight landed, I rushed to the baggage claim because my wife and I had another flight out of London and only had an hour to make it. Even though we could see the plane and watch the baggage crew drive the bags over, it took 45 minutes before my bag came through. The baggage claim service desk turned away 30 other furious customers until a manager could arrive, by which time I was running to catch my next flight on a different airline, which I missed. Turns out the next flight home on our next airline wasn’t for another 6 days. Hoping that British Airways would help us in some way, we went to their horrendous customer service desk where an agent, basically told us to pound sand. It ended up costing my wife and I almost $3000 for new tickets to get home, spent the next 20 hours in the airport and British Airways refused to offer us as a meal voucher. We will never use this airline again."
635,"Not Verified | Amman to London. This is a nice aircraft, with comfortable seats, and a very soft landing. This aircraft flies from Amman airport at 8 am local time and arrives in only 5 hours to London. This is a very good product."
636,✅ Trip Verified | London to Athens. British Airways is a glorified budget airline. A 3.5-hour flight and back to Athens and no food or drinks provided. Ask for a cup of water and they charge you a ridiculous price. An M&S inflated price sandwich is the 'meal'. No entertainment options either. No USB charging on the seat as well. Any reputable airline for a flight of this length provides this options in 2019. Yet they charged full-service airline prices. So there is a mismatch. Flew Aegean on the same route and a full meal and drinks are provided.
637,"Not Verified |  Terrible lack of any leg and body room in economy. This was easily the most cramped space I have ever flown. And I travel a lot. The flight was 7 hours of leg cramps and pain with no room for any modicum of comfort. The little amount of space in economy cabin is disgusting. If the seat in front of you reclines, as they invariably do, there is even less room. Shameful. The food was below average as well, even for bottom of the barrel budget airplane food. I will never fly British Airways again. 0 stars. Beware. I should only add that the NYC JFK and London waiting areas do not have near enough seats requiring many to stand or sit on the floor and the call to plane was disorganized bedlam. Horrible excuse for an airline."
638,"✅ Trip Verified |  Buenos Aires to London Heathrow rwturn. The aircraft is very old, cabin configuration is very old and tired. IFE screens have not been changed since they were first installed. My Ipod has a larger and more responsive screen. Before taking off in Buenos Aires, some pax, but not all, were offered water or orange juice. I never got any. After take off, drinks were offered, followed by a hot meal. Food choices ran out in the first row. Seats were uncomfortable, footrests were jammed. On the return flight, sparkling wine and water were offered before take off, followed by drinks and the meal I had chosen online was a beef stew with mashed potatoes. Poor movie choices, miniature screen and uncomfortable seats. Crew OK. No indication as to which toilets to use, either forward in business class or rear economy. Having flown Norwegian on their B787 in their premium cabin on the same route, BA is a waste of my money. "
639,"✅ Trip Verified | Mexico City to Barcelona via London Heathrow. The B787 is an incredible plane. The legroom is quite good, the seat is comfortable and the IFE has a great number of movies, series and music. The food is average, the first meal was meat with mashed potatoes, salad and wine. Not very tasty. The breakfast was scrambled eggs with mushrooms, fruit and a muffin, it was delicious! The cabin crew was ok. Not bad, not excellent. We arrived on time and was a great flight. On the second flight the cabin crew appeared twice. No IFE, no onboard service. It’s almost like a low cost. I recommend for long flights, but not for European flights."
640,"✅ Trip Verified | Great all round. BA2591, 11 October. Good price, easy boarding, lovely cabin crew, great iced coffee on sale. Comfortable, on time and a nice smile from the cabin and flight crew after a windy landing. Couldn’t ask for more (until they reinstate a free drink and sandwich)."
641,"✅ Trip Verified | Flew back from Abu Dhabi in World traveller plus. The seat is so uncomfortable it does not warrant the price tag of the seat, seat cushioning terrible and zero feeling of comfort, I got no sleep. A snack was served after take off which was quite tasty, but breakfast was just dismal, tasteless. Not much interaction with the crew, but they seemed friendly enough. Would not travel with British Airways in this cabin again, really not worth the price tag."
642,"Not Verified | Flew from London Heathrow to Abu Dhabi. Honestly, they were really good, legroom great, crew excellent - looked after us superbly, food and drinks were bang on, did Vegas in April too, nowt wrong with this airline."
643,"✅ Trip Verified |  Johannesburg to Amsterdam via London. After many delayed departures they announced that the flight was cancelled and rescheduled to depart the following night at 8pm. The following night at 7.30 pm they announced further delays due to the same ""technical"" fault reported 24 hours previously. Finally departed at 10pm, consequences were missed connecting flight to Amsterdam. WE also had to pay for our ""no show"" at our hotel in Amsterdam and when trying to claim this charge from BA they declined but offered to pay for our taxi? Arrived in Amsterdam 30 hours later. What really annoyed us was the lack of communication and disorganized manner on how the events were mishandled. Once on board the crew were really nice and just as we were getting new hope this was shattered by the terrible food and on board entertainment that was outdated. Our connecting BA flight back home was the same thing and on arrival we were delayed on disembarking."
644,"✅ Trip Verified | Dubai to London Heathrow. I flew on the A350 on one of its first trips and will be flying it again. On the same multi segment trip I tried SQ business class and EK business class (and sadly the old BA business class on an aging B777) on overnight trips. The new ""business suite"" offering from BA is the best business class I have experienced. I am a BA Gold card holder and the experience was outstanding. The First lounge at DXB was very good with plenty of seating and a good choice of drinks. Food choice in the lounge was limited but not an issue. On board the new suite was very comfortable and I had a great nights sleep with the closed door making all the difference to getting a full six hours in. The bed was very comfortable. Food choices were very limited (soup and sandwiches) although this did suit the timing of the flight. I would say this is an excellent very serious business product for night time business travellers. Whether it works for leisure travellers who want to wow rather than sleep or daytime travellers I don't know, but I certainly could work very effectively in my suite. Downside is the IFE is still rubbish in relation to the rest of the product."
645,✅ Trip Verified | Istanbul to New York via London. Literally the worst experience. We have tried this airline for the first and definitely last time! They should go through their customer service hiring department from scratch!
646,"✅ Trip Verified |  Yesterday my husband and I decided to to come home from Rome earlier than the scheduled time at 8pm. When I rang BA in London, the customer service adviser was helpful and reassuring and able to change the the flight time to 3pm without having to pay extra. Onboard the flight, the steward gave me hot water and milk so that I can used my own preferred decaf tea and did not charge me. While waiting to get off the plane, I had a wonderful conversation with the BA staff who are so pleasant. I love flying with BA and we will continue to do so. We have booked our flight with BA next year. Thank you for taking good care of us and just to sat how much we appreciate your excellent service."
647,"✅ Trip Verified | Flight from London to Athens with British Airways, was one of the worst experiences. The ""new"" slim seats are so uncomfortable you spend the flight and sadly the next day as well in pain. The screens with flight info have gone, no frills, and airline has become a bad quality budget airline. Sad. Avoid."
648,Not Verified |  Short 45 minute flight north and south with British Airways. Lounge at LHR and also NCL was busy but there was no shortage of seats. Gates for departures and arrivals were very conveniently placed near the airport exits. The seats on the flight were comfortable and the schedule was perfectly on time.
649,"Not Verified |  Calgary to Gothenburg via London with British Airways. Staff are very friendly and helpful. Entertainment was good. Food was just ok, although a salmon sandwich as a snack on a full plane wouldn't be my first choice to serve. The seats are incredibly uncomfortable. Super narrow to the point that you sit with your arms crossed so as to not hit your neighbours. For a 9 hour flight this is painful. Paid for the extra leg room which was good but still one of the most uncomfortable long flights have ever been on. Recommend for short trips."
650,"✅ Trip Verified |  For a long time I have avoided taking British Airways due to it’s poor past reputation. Yesterday I traveled on BA 34 from Kuala Lumpur to London Heathrow, I boarded the flight with an open mind, over 12 hours later I disembarked feeling very happy because it is always good to see an airline make visible improvements that deliver value to it’s customers. A praise is due and I want to congratulate BA for such a pleasant experience, the flight departed on time and arrived half an hour early, the crew was not only professional but they did everything with a smile that made passengers feel welcomed, the plane was pristine new with delightful entertainment content, the food was way above the expectations of a seasoned economy class traveler. What more can I say? Enough to say that I will be traveling with BA again!"
651,"✅ Trip Verified |  Austin to London. Another pleasant flight on an ageing 747. After the horror of discovering one of us was allocated a centre seat, meaning effectively sleeping next to a stranger, she kindly swapped seats so we could be together. For a couple the centre seats are really quite nice and you feel you’re in your own little world. A good flight, on time with a nice crew is as good as you can expect."
652,✅ Trip Verified |  London to Kuala Lumpur. Better than I was expecting after reading the other reviews. The seats are great and service was very friendly on this leg (less so on the return). A few areas need improvement: 1) Separate toilets from economy 2) Dedicated crew for the premium economy section rather than added onto their economy service. 3) A better 2nd meal - The main meal was great and noticeably more premium however the next meal (breakfast) was a bit of an afterthought. Would I choose BA premium Eco again : Yes Definitely.
653,"Not Verified | I wish I could give a zero. I was booked on a flight from Newark to Madrid via London. I come to find that the minimum layover time in London is 1 hr. My flight layover in London was 1hr5min. British Airways promised that the arriving and departing terminals in London were the same, but that was a total lie. My wife and I were sprinting across the airport, but between getting off the aeroplane, having to go through security again, and having to get to the other side of the airport for our connection, we missed the layover flight. We had the same route in the reverse direction. I called BA hoping to change the return flights and explained this situation. They kept insisting that since the layover was a staggering 5 minutes more than London’s minimum 1hr layover threshold that they were unable to help in any way. British Airways has by far the worst customer service I have ever experienced. Ryanair which is a no-frills airline has better customer service and that is saying something. I will never be flying BA again and plan on converting my company away from BA flights as well. Be warned. Stay away from this carrier at all costs or be prepared to deal with zero customer service in case any issues arise."
654,Not Verified |  One of the reasons we traveled club class was because BA have lounges where you can get away from the usual airport chaos and screaming children. BA don’t tell you there is no lounge at Kos airport. Limited seating. Very noisy limited facilities. Not sure I will spend so much on air tickets with them in the future if they don’t warn of limited facilities. It doesn’t help that the flight is delayed by an hour!
655,"Not Verified |  Gatwick to Alicante. On my outbound flight (23 Sept) I gave BA almost 10 out of 10 across the board in a review they invited me to complete. On my return flight (26 Sept) it was a different matter. From entering Alicante airport up until boarding the service was by comparison below standard (except the VIP lounge which was good). Travelling Club Europe had no advantages. Only one check in open for all passengers, no bag drop facilities, no facility to print boarding passes. When invited to board we had to wait 20 minutes on the ramp before being let on the plane. The Iberia factor. Honestly you wouldn't have thought it was the same company. Once on the plane everything went like clockwork."
656,"✅ Trip Verified |  Vancouver to London. Great flight on the superb A380; in my opinion, the most comfortable and quiet aircraft flying at the moment. Outstanding in flight service from the crew. Attentive, polite and professional; the very best of British Airways service. Food well above average for this cabin - though breakfast could have been better. IFE excellent. The seat is comfortable with a good recline and supplied with a decent, plump cushion and an excellent quilted blanket. Very enjoyable flight. Highly recommended."
657,✅ Trip Verified |  Gatwick to Alicante. 3.5 hours (1 hour sitting on tarmac) with my knees rammed against seat in front. No room to move. I have travelled on several airlines on this route in last 12 months - Vueling Airlines has best seats! Stay away from the rest unless you are under 5ft tall!
658,"Not Verified | We have had some torrid experiences with BA - which we have not been shy to report. So when we flew yesterday with them from Heathrow to Austin and had a great flight in every way, it felt right to feedback on that. The staff in the upstairs business class cabin were, frankly, wonderful. Cheerful, efficient and calm. What more could you ask? The food was pretty nice and the champagne lovely. The beds were very comfortable and sleeping was easy. I literally cannot think of any real negatives. The luggage lockers were quite small but then it’s an older model of the plane so that probably explains it. If only BA could deliver this kind of experience on every occasion, they would once again be the “world’s favourite airline’. Sadly, the current CEO doesn’t seem able to inspire and motivate his staff to be consistently delightful. Perhaps once he moves on we can expect something better. Although the flight was a bit delayed on departure it arrives bang on time. As we entered the (literally empty) immigration area, we were met by the most charming customs officer you can imagine, who ended up giving us tourist tips and ideas for bars! Surreal, as anyone who regularly travels to the States, will testify! It felt as if we were living in the Truman Show at one point but in the nicest possible way. Get yourselves down to good ole Austin now that BA fly there direct. Fantastic."
659,"✅ Trip Verified | London Heathrow to Austin with British Airways. It was a little bit like going back in time to fly upper deck on a 747 to Austin. But, it was the most enjoyable flight we’ve taken for a long time. It was so quiet on our deck and we had a fantastic flight crew who couldn’t do enough for you, and always with a smile. We arrived as fresh as you can from 10 hours in the air, on time, and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The only slight issue was the very IFE systems and small overhead lockers. But plenty of spare lockers and our iPads took are of that."
660,"Not Verified |  I did not actually fly because of their pilot strike. This review is because of the poor service to its customers who were due to fly on the days of the strike. I immediately tried to rebook with the only other airline that flew to Jersey, but of course, they had put their air fares up for the day in question and had to pay £110 more for a return flight. I then cancelled my BA flight, but they only refunded £159 of the £187 I had paid. The £28 difference was picking my seats. How do they consider that not part of the cost of the flight? They should have refunded me everything as it was not my fault they were striking. I completed their complaint form a month ago and they have never responded to me. 2 weeks ago I phoned their Customer Service line and the person I spoke to said he would refund me the £28. I never received the refund. "
661,"✅ Trip Verified | The start of our journey back from from EFL was inauspicious, with hundreds of delayed and stranded passengers crammed into the departure lounge, awaiting flights on airlines other than BA. As it was, weather in the UK plus air traffic control issues meant that departure was delayed by 90 minutes. Once airborne in a refitted A320 (complete with a nice fresh leather smell!), cabin crew in CE were friendly and efficient, and the food (including a cod dish) was quite reasonable. It was interesting to note that the refit hadn't extended to the toilet which was looking distinctly worse for the wear. A big plus on the flight - and a first for me - was WiFi, which actually worked and was quite fast - although at a cost of £4.99 for an hour's use. I thought it was meant to be free for business class passengers, but evidently not. Landing made up for some time but we were parked right in the middle of nowhere because of a backlog of flights. However, BA had laid on a separate bus for CE passengers and we were out of the airport 30 minutes later. So, not too bad, all in all."
662,"Not Verified | Chicago to Zurich via London. Delays after delays. The flight was supposed to depart at 8:30 pm (Chicago Time) but was scheduled at 9:40 pm, we waited a long time at the airport. Finally, at 10 pm we managed to board on the A380 for my first time but the legroom was horrible. The IFE completely unfunctional and with no food served. During the taxi, a technical problem occurred and we returned to the gate. In the end, the plane took off at 12 am Chicago time and we arrived in London Heathrow at 2 pm. We had to wait 3 hours for boarding for another 30 minutes delayed flight. We arrived in Zurich on an old A319 at 9:30 pm Zurich time instead of the original 3:30 pm. Very stressful at least the staff were nice."
663,"✅ Trip Verified | Glasgow to London. Smooth flight, departure/arrival on time. Boarding was quick, the seat was ok. Although I had pre-ordered a vegetarian option, the caterer hadn't provided any (so they said) - but the flight attendant quickly solved the issue. The food was good, and the wine (french, Bourgogne) also surprisingly good. Flight attendant was professional, polite and attentive to detail. All in all, a great flight."
664,"✅ Trip Verified | Having booked this flight a week before the BA strike and mistakingly thinking that the strike would have ended two days before I flew and not in fact the day before, I was apprehensive as to how it would operate. The check-in and security clearance at T5 took only 15 minutes. Personally I do not like the self service bag and tag drop that BA operate as one is not 100% confident that I did everything correctly. Boarding is by the new fare group system (1 to 5) which depends on how much one has paid for the ticket. Again I'm not a fan of this. Possibly due to the previous day's strike and the need to accommodate passengers from canceled flights, the aircraft was a large A321. Boarding was however smooth. On board the virtually full cabin was very clean and the EuroTraveller seats were comfortable and offer sufficient leg room (I'm 1m.79cm and my knees do not touch the seat in front). The departure was only 15 minutes behind the scheduled departure time. In flight there were 3 cabin staff in the Euro Traveller cabin (believe 2 in Club cabin) who were very efficient and friendly and so one only had to wait no more than 30 minutes from take off to purchase refreshments on such a full flight. Again it is a shame though that BA have gone down the no frills line and charge for food and drinks when they describe themselves as a full service airline. The landing at Tegel was 30 minutes ahead of schedule. All in all it was a pleasant flight and the value was very good as it was combined with a hotel booking. Tegel itself is a bit of hassle with only 2 border police carrying out immigration controls for over 200 passengers at the end of the airbridge and a further 30 minute wait for luggage but this was not BA's fault."
665,"✅ Trip Verified |  I wouldn't even rate them 1/10 2 x business class passengers booked via On Business. 1 bag lost in transit. Ground crew in MXP rude, dismissive & most unhelpful, unable to locate missing bag. Waited for next flight to arrive, still no bag. Decided to cut short our trip as the bag contained essential meds - ok that's a lesson learnt the hard way. Due to this being an OB booking BA customer services unwilling to be flexible and change tickets resulting in full fare tickets purchased to return. Apparently the bag arrived 24hrs later, we were back in the UK, despite BA website showing in transit LHR/MXP for 8 days! Numerous lengthy calls to customer service proved fruitless, passed from one department to another then cut off! After an email to their CEO & Director of Brand and Customer Experience received a call from Global Engagement Executive Team offering £100 e-voucher. Abysmal customer services. No wonder their reputation is in tatters. I will never fly BA again."
666,✅ Trip Verified | Flying London City to Geneva. The only plus was the Embraer E190 jet had a comfortable interior with plenty of leg room for an economy seat. Other than that BA now offers a basic no frills service that is no different to a budget airline. Yet it charges 'full service' prices!
667,"✅ Trip Verified |  Los Angeles to Istanbul via London. Flight between London and Istanbul is like coach, no TV and small leg room. Transatlantic business seats are very narrow and mine did not become a complete bed. Food was below average. The Heathrow BA business lounge was a cramped, tasteless, dirty lounge . It took us 25 min to find two chairs to seat. Food was  awful and service is even worst. When we wanted to change our departure date by a few days we had to pay a penalty of $500 plus fee change, so we ended up paying $800 per person in addition to the fare already paid. "
668,✅ Trip Verified | Phoenix to Tel Aviv via London. The return from London to Phoenix was a nightmare. I want everyone to know that I sent a complaint 3 times but there is no one to talk to. This is not something that I am used to.
669,"Not Verified |  London to Kefalonia . The T5 Galleries lounge is showing its age and was packed at 9:30 on a Saturday. Boarding was by the now standard groups, which meant waiting 15 minutes in a queue and then 10 minutes on the bridge. The flight deck then informed us that we’d be waiting on a stand for 1 hr 20 minutes before our departure slot. Once in the air, cabin crew delivered the usual Club Europe experience, which was mediocre at best. Fortunately, arrival was only 45 minutes late and we were out of Kefalonia airport 30 minutes later. Overall, a typical BA experience that’s lacklustre at best."
670,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Dublin. It was never my choice to fly with British Airways and I will never fly with them again. I was supposed to fly with American Airlines from the USA to Dublin, but I had a connecting flight from my origin city to Chicago. Unfortunately, my first flight was delayed due to weather, which caused me to miss the flight from Chicago to Dublin. I was put on a flight to London instead, which I had to run for when I finally made it to Chicago, and my bag did not make it on the flight. I then flew with British Airways from London to Dublin. I was told to file a lost baggage claim with BA, which I did. I was told that the bag would be transferred from American to BA when it arrived in Dublin. Using American’s baggage tracking system, I was able to confirm that the bag arrived the day after I did around noon on Saturday. I am writing this review on the following Sunday and the bag is still not in my possession. BA’s customer service is terrible. If someone there tells me one more time to just wait and be patient, I am going to lose it! My bag has been sitting at the airport in the same city I’m in for more than a day and I can’t get it. Talk about serious frustration. I don’t know which airline is at fault for the delay, but the difference is that when I called American, the rep did everything she could to find out the status of my bag. And even though their baggage claim desk was closed when I called, she still tried to call an internal number to see if anyone was still around. Unfortunately she couldn’t get hold of anyone, but she left them a message and told me exactly who I could call and when to call them the next morning. I did not receive that level of service from BA. I even asked if they could call the airport and was told, “we are not authorized to call airports.” Why in the world wouldn’t they be authorized to call their own baggage department? I am not thrilled with either airline, but at least American has made some attempt to help me. This has ruined the first three days of a trip that I planned for two years. If you do check a bag and it’s lost or delayed, don’t expect any help if you flew with BA. And here’s a tip: if you are dealing with a lost or delayed bag in a country you don’t live in, don’t call the generic customer service number on the website you would normally use. Dig around and see if you can find a number for the airport you flew into. You will get a lot more information and assistance that way. "
671,"✅ Trip Verified |  Hong Kong to London. An email on the 25th August advising us that this flight was cancelled and the hours spent on hold never speaking to anyone, what a total awful nightmare. Then the email at 6.00pm saying I must be delighted to find out my flight has not been cancelled. All slots in the Elemis Salon were already booked so no massages were available in First Class. Arriving at HK airport on the return journey and struggling even to get from the pavement to the inside of the terminal (why did they not tell us to print out proof of travel??). We had to wait ages for BA to open a check in desk, pretty average food and service in the Qantas lounge. A broken screen in seat 59A (it would not stay in position and without wedging, unusable to constant interruptions during the flight to my partner from a large passenger climbing over him. A ghastly sweet and sour chicken main course which made me send my tray away and not eat until after leaving the flight. Cheapest goodies bag with the broken zip and my suitcase was the very last off the plane. I had already been to the BA desk and reported it when it then eventually turned up on the conveyor belt. First class out to HK was a good business class experience, the return flight in business class was in a word poor. The plane was tired, IFE faulty, poor food and the journey was only saved by the quality of the staff, they were lovely - but if you give them rubbish tools they will serve rubbish. The night term pantry offering was a total joke. I have been a BA Exec card holder since for ever and I have seen is a decline in the service level. Certainly not value for money, we did not get a Club class experience on the flight home."
672,"✅ Trip Verified |  Gatwick to Seville. When my son and his girlfriend proceeded to drop their hand luggage a member of staff insisted in making them pay 50GBP because one of the suitcases was 4cm oversize, and he insisted that it was not a hand luggage. Staff said that if he did not pay, he would lose the flight."
673,"✅ Trip Verified | London to Abuja-flight full, aircraft an older version of 777-200. Evening meal served which was very ordinary but we arrived more or less on time after dodging thunderstorms near Abuja. Return flight delayed - pilot strike meant our aircraft had been parked at Lagos - and had to be flown back to Abuja with a 2 hour delay. Flight was supposed to be a 8 am departure but the airport side did not have the sense to tell us so we were herded into the gate area where there was no food facility and waited for the flight. The crew were also herded into the gate area and it was the same crew we had on the outward flight and the same plane - they had also had to have a long foodless wait but were quite chatty as we were all in the same boat. Flight totally full as flights on previous days had been cancelled. Breakfast was served but there was no evidence of the standard of meals being improved-scrambled egg was just a lump of tasteless yellow. Full credit to the crew - cheerful and efficient in spite of all the delays etc. The aircraft was clean but old and down at heel - the carpet under the seat in front was ripped and the ""floor"" was visible."
674,✅ Trip Verified |  London to Bangkok. What an awful plane. Seats are just about OK going. Coming back it seemed like a bar going across the bottom back part of the seat. Really uncomfortable. The meals are fine but alas the last meal is served just over an hour before landing and rushed. The main problem is the entertainment on a small scratched screen and about 15 films. Rubbish. Took 2 hours to get the screens to actually work. The plane looks old and tired. Not a pleasure to travel on this plane.
675,"✅ Trip Verified |  Belfast to San Francisco via London. Check-in at Belfast City was fast and trouble free and security was completed with-in just a few minutes with no queues to mention. Boarding was direct from the Business Lounge and on time as was departure. A full breakfast service was carried out including hot towels, hot breakfast, tea and coffee along with drinks from the bar on request. The Galleries Lounge in Terminal 5 at Heathrow was very busy with limited seats available. Boarding for the second flight began on time and departure swift. The inflight service was top notch with a very capable crew looking after the customers on the upper deck in a professional and discrete manner. Food was plentiful and tasty, entertainment perfectly adequate and seat comfort fine. No complaints at all about the flight and would recommend British Airways."
676,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Gothenburg. BA are getting a lot of bad press - deservedly so at present with strikes, IT glitches, baggage problems. However extreme cases will always be highlighted. Two recent flights on BA, and very happy with them. Flight to Gothenburg on A319-100, pushed back 25m late due to a potential technical issue, soon resolved and arrived at GOT only 15m behind schedule. Good crew and the Safety Announcement video was a hoot. Return to LHR on A320-232. On time departure and early arrival at T5. Again good crew. Will be flying with BA again in December (strikes permitting). Still recommended by me as the National Carrier."
677,"✅ Trip Verified |  Orlando to Gatwick. Terrible flight experience, bed bugs in old Club world seats, missed meals, poor service. Complaints is outsourced to a German company who aren't even part of BA!  Do not fly BA and club world is a waste of money."
678,"✅ Trip Verified | Mahe to Stockholm via London. Checked in online before the flight but had to do the bag drop. Was met by a rude lady at First class check in and the process took about 20 minutes, don’t know why, no apology. The boarding was in time. The welcome wasn’t especially friendly, just pointing the direction where to go. The club Europe cabin felt claustrophobic, I had a window seat. The CSM never came to say hello. The service was pretty basic, ok during the meals but self service between. No drink service if you didn’t ask. On the flight to Stockholm the purser introduced himself to all emerald members. The service was limited due to the strike next day but friendly. The seating was terrible on this A320, so tight."
679,"✅ Trip Verified |  Glasgow to Tampa via Gatwick. Early morning flight Glasgow to Gatwick. Flight dud take off at 6.45. Boarded with doors closed by 6.30 bug did not depart till 7.10 due to Gatwick being busy, smooth flight down. Gatwick to Tampa, according to manage my booking, aircraft changed 2 days prior to departure. At boarding was told our World Traveller plus seats had been upgraded to Club World, a very pleasant surprise. If was on 777 which had not been refurbished, extra space was very good, staff were very efficient and pleasant. Only downside was the main meal, which I would have had in original seats, but main courses were not to my liking, but afternoon tea was very good. So thank you BA for the experience."
680,"Not Verified |  Orlando to Gatwick. Travelling home was extremely disappointing. The aircraft was dirty - drink stains on the side of the cabin and the remains of chewing gum on the seatbelt. The aircraft aisle was so narrow you had to walk sideways to prevent bumping into other passengers. The aircraft had a broken toilet and lights that could not be turned off, so for a night flight part of the cabin was illuminated which made sleep difficult. The breakfast was a garlic cream cheese croissant which tasted revolting and a highly processed cereal bar. Only one drinks run was made. The standards on BA have plummeted since we last flew them seven years ago, such a shame. I hope management are looking at reviews such as this, to improve service."
681,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Abu Dhabi. This is the daytime flight from London. A very good flight. The food was excellent for economy (particularly in view of Etihad‘s disastrous changes in food service). The children’s meals were excellent. The entertainment system was great with a good selection. It makes a big difference having the entertainment system on when you board and not turn it off until the plane has reached the gate, especially when flying with children (Etihad, why don’t you do this?). The cabin crew were good. Economy in the 787 is cramped but probably no worse than many. Good value flight, especially as the only other carrier to Abu Dhabi is Etihad."
682,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to St Petersburgh. Huge disappointment for BA business class service in European routes. Seat pitch has been reduced to 30"" over the last years (from 34"") at the expense of passenger comfort. Seat width is the same as economy with empty middle seat. Food for me was half-empty plates representing a deli experience, and leaving me hungry. Out of the three options offered, two were already out of stock, so stranded with the least favourable and most unhealthy food option. Avoid Club Europe, not worth the money."
683,"✅ Trip Verified |  Sydney to London via Singapore with British Airways. I made the mistake of ordering vegetarian meals on this flight - the food was horrendous, I was served an indistinguishable uniform mass of what appeared to be mashed, overcooked potatoes (and maybe other vegetables, I am not sure) for one meal and an ice cold frittata/sandwich which should clearly have been heated up. The latter I took one bite and couldn't continue. I have had better meals in economy class in other airlines. The seat was nothing to write home about, but noticeably comfortable compared to economy class (with the price difference to match of course). The service was lacking and quite perfunctory when it is available. On the plus side, I am glad there are shared toilets between business and premium economy class at the front of the cabin, instead of having to walk all the way to the back of the plane like some other flights. Paid for in-flight wifi for an a hour - disconnected after 40 minutes and no longer able to use. Reasonable price and speed."
684,"Not Verified |  London to Johannesburg. British Airways is one of the few commercial carriers in the world that charges an exorbitant amount in fees when booking travel. But in addition, if you want to ensure you and your spouse will sit together on the flight, you need to pay a high price to secure seat assignments. With that said in 2018, my wife and I made reservations on BA to fly to Johannesburg from London for an African adventure this October, specifically 10/31. Yes, that's the day called for Brexit. Only we made our reservations before those dates were set. Considering BA pilots have called for three pilot strikes on September 2019, coupled with Brexit, we decided to change our flight plan because we did not want to risk missing our connection. The good news is close to $800 in fees for our two Business Class tickets was refunded when I changed our flights to another carrier through American Airlines Advantage. The bad news is the $220.00 we had to pay to reserve our seats was not refunded. I called BA to request a refund and the agent and a supervisor told me their policy is to not refund seat reservation expenses. I was just not feeling the love here! So I am writing this missive to warn anyone traveling abroad to not fly British Airways. All of the other outstanding carriers don't charge nearly the high fees and most don't charge for reserving your seats in advance. Instead of BA, we changed our booking to 10/30 on Etihad Airways through Abu Dhabi. Their customer service was outstanding. The fees were lower and yes, no charge to have the peace of mind that my wife and I can travel next to each other. I am entering travel in September 2019, because there was no other option for future travel. This request for a refund comes two months in advance of our planned flight. This is an airline policy review and lets the buyer beware."
685,"✅ Trip Verified | I have to say travelling in Club Europe is a waste of money. The food was no better than economy food from the past. The seats are just the same as in economy although you get a middle tray, and probably worst of all the cabin was full of a lot of arrogant people who thought that just because they were not in economy it somehow made them more worthy people. This might be a British trait as I’ve travelled business class on other airlines and not had the same experience."
686,"Not Verified |  I had a stress free journey with my 8 yr old autistic son and 6 yr old girl from Chennai to London by British airways. The Chennai Ground Service Manager recogonised my sunflower lanyard and came forward to help me throughout the services right from pushing my trolley, screening the luggage, checking through the security without much stress and finally boarding the aircraft as the second person. I am stunned by the service and am so glad to know that they recognise and respect and help us for the hidden disability and for making our journey really really smooth. Thank you so much. Inside the aircraft the crew members did come forward and asked if I need any help, and another member did congratulate me for wearing the lanyard as the first person for him to see me with lanyard. I did even use the disabled way to clear my immigration at Heathrow airport. Over all i am happy to say that my trip with my kids has been really smooth with BA and Heathrow airport. #happyautism# Thank you"
687,✅ Trip Verified |  Edinburgh to Kuala Lumpur via London. I have just returned to KL from an extended visit in UK seeing family and friends. My return flight was BA033 from Heathrow to Kuala Lumpur on Monday 26th August 2019 at 21.10. I was greeted by the most delightful air hostess whose name I didn't quite catch. The point I wish to make is that she looked after me so well on the flight. She was exceptional. It really made the journey one of the best on board experiences I have had. 
688,"✅ Trip Verified |  I was supposed to fly from London City to Amsterdam on 24/7, Business Class. Once at LCY, my early pm flight appeared as cancelled. A state of confusion broke out at the airport, with people trying to find alternatives, however I managed to be rebooked on a later flight. On a busy day, I waited for hours at the airport. The new flight was displayed as “delayed” for 45mins. the delay kept on increasing, with the flight ultimately scheduled to depart after 10pm. I kept on waiting. The flight eventually ended up cancelled as well. Result: half a day wasted at LCY. I feel that BA’s punctuality and quality of customer service have been declining significantly lately. Delays and cancellations can happen, however I have been flying BA +/- 30 times a year and the % of flights delayed has been abnormally high lately, especially to/from Amsterdam and Germany. Also, the customer service seems to have a “minimum care” proposition (provide what is strictly required by the law, only if customers complain, taking as long as possible), that genuinely makes you feel worthless as a customer, whether you are a frequent flyer or not."
689,"✅ Trip Verified |  I purchased a ticket for Dublin to Mauritius on British Airways for 23 Feb 2019. On the day of travel, a few hours before the departure time, I realized that I would not be able to make it and so I got in touch with British Airways on Twitter advising them of my cancellation. When I arrived home, I asked them to officially cancel my ticket and issue me a refund. I understood that my ticket was a non-refundable one, but it says on the ticket that surcharges, taxes and airport fees would be refundable which should have amounted to at least 250 euro. However, all the airline  refunded me was a pitiful 50 euro. I have been trying to speak to British Airways on Twitter many times over the past few months, and they never responded positively, only insisting that they were doing the right thing and that their position would not change. British Airways is being dishonest and should be avoided."
690,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Shanghai. The Concorde room in Heathrow Terminal 5 was amazing, the dinner experience was great and the food was delicious. However, the First galleries was overcrowded and the buffet was bad. On the plane, the crew was very friendly and nice. Dinner service was finished 1 hour after take off, the food was okay. Bed was made after dinner and it was very comfortable, perhaps the best I have had. The entertainment system was not as good as other airlines like Qatar Airlines and Emirates. Overall, the journey was great."
691,"Not Verified |  I have often flown British Airways and have considered them a good airline. However, their customer service has fallen to such a level that I must say it is terrible. If you have no problems this is a good airline. If you have any problems you will not be able to get any help. I recently flew to London from Chicago. They erroneously cancelled my seats although I had checked in over 5 hours before he flight. They then downgraded my seat and put me on the plane. They then lost my luggage for 15 days. These things happen but customer service was impossible to use. When you call, you almost always get a message that says they are busy and the phone automatically hangs up. If you send in a request for help via the website you will get only a robo generated message that they will get back to you. They do not. You can't find out the status of your inquiry and only get a looping set of computer messages. Do not take this airline if customer service may be important to you."
692,"Not Verified |  Good morning. I would like to write a review for British Airways. It took me a while to write this review as I it took me a while to get over what happened to me. But I feel that the way British Airways behaved needs a review for their valiant efforts. Last year I went with my 9 year old son and my 80 year old friend to New Orleans from London on the holiday of a life time. I was pregnant at the time. The baby died while I was on holiday there and I was in a turmoil of emotions. Regardless I tried to make the holiday a positive experience for my son and friend and carried on, all the while just wanting to go home as treatment needed to take place in England. Somehow I missed the flight back. I have no excuse for this. When I realised I was in a complete state. I had a break down. I rang BA and sobbed down the phone. They were beyond amazing! They arranged a flight back home the same day without any extra cost. We all sat together and we were able to fly home that day and I was in hospital the day afterwards. Customer service was outstanding. So compassionate and helpful. And again they did not ask for a penny for our return flights. I am beyond grateful for their help. I will only ever fly BA on long haul if possible."
693,"✅ Trip Verified | My flight was cancelled 3 days in a row. Was flying out on Thursday and finally after days and hours of arguing with BA, I got a flight out Saturday night with Swiss Air. They on the other hand actually fly and on time. Everything about the customer service, customer relations has been terrible, hours of waiting on the phone, no answers on email. My other flights with BA this year has been delayed too. They have for two months promised to reimburse me on all my expenses and to pay the penalty fine of 700$. First 10 days, then 21 bank days and now we are way passed anything else that they have not transferred the money yet. So far nothing and the complaint has been turned over to CAA and the Danish Aviation Authority."
694,"✅ Trip Verified |  Hong Kong to Copenhagen via London. The whole experience is a nightmare to me and my wife. My wife lost her luggage ever since the first day of our journey on 1st August because our two pieces of luggage were left in Heathrow Airport by BA staff when we took the transit flight from the UK to Copenhagen. We went to Menzies in CPH and they filed a repor. We stated in the missing report that if the luggage was found, they should be sent to our air b&b house in Marstal in CPH on or before 3rd August or deliver to the hotel we stayed in CPH if they were found on 4th August. On 2nd August, we found that the updated status of our missing luggage in the BA website showed that one of our luggage was found while another one had a possible match. Therefore, we kept phoning and emailing Menzies staff to urge them to send the luggage to our house but they failed to do so. And the website status showed that we chose to pick up the luggage in the airport, which was not our preference but we failed to change the preference on the website as it was preset. The system even changed the latest delivery date to 3th August 2020 instead of 2019 and we could not correct it by ourselves! On 3rd August, Menzies staff still failed to deliver the luggage to us so we told them we decided to pick them up at the airport. Unfortunately, when we went to the CPH airport on the 4th August, they told us that they had already sent the 'found' luggage to the island in Marstal on 4th. Apparently they did not follow our instructions and sent it to the wrong place on the wrong date. They then asked us to find the other luggage that had been scanned with a possible match randomly in the trolleys outside their office. We did find the other one by ourselves in the airport, which they claimed had been sent to the island but they insisted that it was the possible match one! They were so incompetent and even asked us to complain to the BA to push them to find the baggage for us. We believe that the baggage was the one which was sent to the island but is still missing but the staff messed it up. We were so confused which bag was really missing. We finally decided to ask them to deliver the luggage in Marstal to the airport and send it to the UK address which was our next destination. When we came back to the hotel in the evening on the 4th, we phoned Menzies again and found out that our luggage in Marstal had been sent back to the airport at 8 pm on the 4th. Hence, we decided to pick it up by ourselves on the 5th August before we flew to the UK. However, when we came to the airport again, we couldn't find our luggage and the staff didn't explain why and just told us to leave. If the luggage was sent it to the airport on the 4th, how come it would disappear on the 5th? The staff just kept saying that they were busy and that no one had time to look for the baggage for us. This service was totally unacceptable. We spnet hours parking at the airport and found that we got nothing! You can't imagine how furious and frustrated we were! We are literally sick of phoning Menzies staff every day and not getting anywhere. Now that Menzies staff asked us to pressure BA to in turn pressure them to locate our luggage. That's how ridiculous things have been for us. We are sure that you could do something about it. My wife has lost all her personal belongings since day 1 of our trip."
695,✅ Trip Verified | London Gatwick to San Jose Costa Rica. This was a very similar experience outbound and inbound. I am sure the plane was the same. I am a gold card holder and until this moment have always chosen BA. I am seriously considering not doing this again. The 777-200 we flew in business was dirty and old. I flew my family of 5 business class but 2 of the 5 seats did not operate - no headphones socket jack that operated. The screens were from the ark. Crew as always excellent but BA should be ashamed that they charge business class rates for this experience. I was told by the crew that they would contact me to tell me what would be outcome of the issue. I have heard to date zip. At least it was better than last year flying into DC from London when the seat did not recline even with a manual adjuster. That time at least we received AVIOS. The customer service is increasingly low cost in feel.
696,"Not Verified |  Inflight crew were very helpful, polite and caring. Though you can not call the in flight service as luxurious compared to some airlines, it was quite pleasant. The food and drink selection was pretty basic. However the ground staff especially at the check in counter in DXB and lost & found at London heathrow were rude and very unhelpful. I forgot to collect my suit which I had handed to crew member at the time of boarding. Upon approaching the BA counter, the personnel were not willing to help or register a lost and found complain.  Neither any empathy nor any willingness to help."
697,"✅ Trip Verified | From Toronto to Pisa British Airways used a wet leased Air Belgium plane. Crew on board very friendly and helpful but at times struggled to provide full dinner service speedily. Food was excellent. Business Class cabin comfortable. Weather related delay and blocked arrival gate resulted in short connection time at LHR. To our great surprise British Airways waited for us at the exit of the plane and drove our family (7 people ranging from 3 to 62 years) from Terminal 5 to Terminal 3, escorted us through security and brought us to and even through our departure gate and onto our flight to Pisa. Without this transfer help we would have missed our connection. Flight to Pisa on time, good crew, good on board catering, arrived 15 minutes before the time."
698,"✅ Trip Verified | A very good service on board this flight with British Airways from LHR to VCE. Although the flight was about 30 minutes delayed due to an aircraft change from an Airbus A319 to and Airbus A320, we arrived only slightly behind the scheduled arrival time. The crew were welcoming and informative and the plane was very clean (probably because the plane was relatively new). The seat was not too bad either with quite good leg room. One small issue that I could raise is that there was no complimentary food and beverage on board, you had to pay or use Avios (it isn't that bad as it was only to Europe). An overall very good experience on board this flight."
699,"✅ Trip Verified | This was the worst experience I have ever had flying. There was sufficient time in Chicago to transfer our bags from American Airlines. AA verified that they delivered the bags to BA but they were not on our flight when we reached London. The bags did not arrive and we spent two days in London without our bags. I left a earphone hard case on the plane, but your Lost and Found never answered to file a claim. Your website was horrible to use to file this claim and I have heard nothing. On the return flight from London to Newark, your baggage inspectors obviously opened my suitcase and never replaced the lock. With an experience like this on our first vacation to London, I would do everything to never fly British Airways again."
700,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Larnaca. New A321neo, 4.5 hour flight. The aircraft was narrow, the food simple nothing worth spending my money. The staff was friendly but spending money on a 5 hour flight on such a small plane doesn't worth it. No entertainment onboard. It is a small plane for this duration. "
701,Not Verified |  Gatwick to Orlando. Excellent customer service. On arriving at Gatwick airport and checking in I learn that my interpretation of the USA esta rules was wrong and that I would have to apply for a new esta valid for the duration of my trip. This took longer than it should have and BA kept check in open for my party and a member of their check in staff came and found Me in the terminal and got our bags checked in and our boarding passes and got us rushed down to our waiting aircraft. The aircraft was clean and despite my best efforts we left on time. During the flight drinks were served and two food services. Towards the end of the flight I developed a bad nose bleed the stewardess that attended me was very kind and caring. So despite my best attempts to be a bad passenger BA really came through for me. The return journey went without a hitch and BA's check in at Orlando was quick and easy.
702,✅ Trip Verified |  London to Munich. The plane is A320. The seat is more comfortable than other airlines A320. It has a very comfortable headrest and it is made from leather. There is enough legroom. However there is no free food and drinks provided.
703,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Glasgow. BA customer service is unquestionably the least helpful, least accommodating, least friendly and least responsive so called service available. They clearly train their staff in the multitude of ways to frustrate their customers. I will try to avoid this airline from this point on. "
704,✅ Trip Verified |  The seating configuration meant that we were packed in like sardines. The seats are aging and uncomfortable. The forward-backward configuration is the most stupid I have seen. The cabin had 8 seats to a row and about 100 people packed into a crowded and noisy cabin. To book a specific seat you have to pay extra or try your luck 24 hours ahead of the flight. 
705,"✅ Trip Verified | No problems at the airport in Vienna, it was easy to find the British Airways check in desk. The flight was on time. The cabin crew was very kind and the flight was very pleasant. I also ordered a tomato mozzarella flatbread, and it was very delicious. The only problem was at Heathrow, because the gate bridge had a malfunction, so we had to wait for about an hour at the aircraft. But it is not an airliner mistake. After all I enjoyed the flight with British Airways."
706,✅ Trip Verified |  Malaga to London Heathrow . A shambolic airline. Rude and incompetent Iberia ground staff in Malaga. BA sent warning of the 2 hour delay just before the late boarding began - sophisticated IT setup they have! Club Europe meal remains a big cutback from 2017 despite what BA claim. Cabin staff were bored from the start and despite 4 serving in Club cabin the service was very poor. Arrived Heathrow at 23.45 and then sat waiting 10 mins for ground staff to show up.  Simply appalling trip and truly ripped off.
707,✅ Trip Verified |  Sydney to Singapore. Extremely disappointed trip. They are unable to even track our checked baggage when we found it was missing on the baggage carousel. Our baggage should have been premium handled as we were at business class but what happened was they can’t even tell if the baggage was loaded or not at departure. Many important things are in the checked baggage and we’ll have further trip later on which affected us badly. No response so far and the hotline they provided is always engaged
708,"✅ Trip Verified |  London Heathrow to Inverness. Having previously written a review about the shockingly appalling experience with BA so far this summer, I felt the need to update with a new review as the final flight home I was rebooked on - after short-notice cancellation, which I had to wait over a day for - was also  cancelled due to a fault with the aircraft. We were sat on the plane for over an hour whilst the crew were waiting to hear from ground crew what was happening and where to go. Eventually got off the plane to utter chaos - mixed messages being given by ground crew. Some people given details about rebooking, others given nothing. Some people were sent texts with rebooking options, others (including me) received nothing. Vouchers handed out for hotel accommodation and shuttle bus to and from the hotels - however some people were only given one bus voucher, meaning they had no means to return to the airport the next day! Some people rebooked on a flight in two days time and told they’d have to return to the airport the next morning anyway to get any further refreshment or accommodation vouchers. Utterly appalling. Now I’m hoping against hope I might make it home today, 3 days after setting off!"
709,Not Verified |  Heathrow to Glasgow. Again flight is delayed. It’s easier to use the train than fly with BA the staff don’t even get embarrassed anymore and stand smiling offering apologies to the tired and weary customers. Trouble is there is no other operators and it a case of take it or leave it. Very tired and disappointed to be paying my hard earned salary for this terrible service.
710,"✅ Trip Verified | A supremely awful experience from beginning to end. Flight to Vancouver delayed by 4 hours due to a plane defect that had been resolved the previous day but somehow no attempt made to make up the time in between. Only told once on board what the problem was. Delays at baggage reclaim meant I didn’t get out of Vancouver airport until after midnight (originally scheduled to arrive 6.55pm). This affected a camping trip, the booking for which could not be changed. Flight home marred by massive queues at baggage check in and on the plane, due to IT faults, none of which were communicated until we were seated on the plane and told they could not leave until passenger information could get through to the crew. Due to more IT faults the inflight entertainment was not working so nothing to watch for the 9 hour flight. Food was awful and we got a choice of one meal. Spent hours at Heathrow airport awaiting my flight home to Inverness only to be told by text one hour before departure that it was cancelled. Queued for hours to get some information from someone. They rebooked me on a flight for 26 hours later without checking this was ok - only discovered it was over a day later when I was handed my boarding pass. This means I’ve missed a trip with friends to the Edinburgh festival. Had to source my own hotel and food etc and reclaim on expenses - a lot of money coming out of my account whilst I wait for this. Now I’m seeing my rebooked flight is already delayed and was told by customer service that there’s no telling whether my bags will arrive with me - I have to wait at baggage reclaim and see! If they are not on the flight I have no information as to when I can expect to have my belongings back with me. These are merely the most significant issues, there were more and I’m really shocked at what a consistently terrible service has been provided. Between this, massive fines for data breaches and the fact that BA seem to have quite consistent and severe issues with IT, it is beyond my comprehension how they can still be in business."
711,Not Verified |  British Airways flight to Brussels from Heathrow. Check in problems and a hugely delayed flight. Pay premium prices for a below average service. They need to invest in their IT systems and greatly up their game.
712,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Nice. I agree totally with the comments made in Michael Croft's review today. My flight to Nice was cancelled as a result of the low-cost and unreliable IT system that BA have, while the senior management are likely celebrating somewhere that they managed to cut more costs. The handling of the situation at Heathrow was despicable, and you would think that with all the failures that BA encounter these days, they would have got this part of their act together. They make out such a problem is a bolt from the blue, when clearly they have not been investing where they should, instead focussing on cost cutting to boost their performance bonuses. Not just the CEO should go, but some others at the top."
713,"✅ Trip Verified |  Palma to London Heathrow. How does British Airways get away with having such a useless IT system and presumably team of IT staff / management? These issues recur on such a frequent basis it is now time for some heads to roll, preferably from the CEO down. Just read a fatuously stupid interview with Alex Cruz talking about how his children are guiding him on the future of air travel, when this man cannot manage to run the airline properly in 2019 - let alone try to make himself look all eco-friendly with such comments. I have been a loyal customer for over 48 years, and it seems that BA have not the slightest interest in those of us that pay full fares and have been through all the lows of BA without complaint until now. My patience has run out. "
714,"✅ Trip Verified |  London City to Ibiza. Disappointing. All the flights were cancelled without explanation - presumably because the striking staff didn't turn up, so trip was ruined. Got a replacement ticket for a different destination on a different week. Trip was basic. The meal consisted of two small shortbread biscuits. British Airways is now firmly in the bucket airlines, easily beaten by Easyjet"
715,"Not Verified |  London to Faro. We booked our tickets (family of 7) two months before the flight with British Airways so we could enjoy the quality and the service (so we thought). Inbound flight seats has been booked and paid (quite high amount for 7 seats) for the row 2 and 3. Outbound flight row 6 and 7. Two weeks before the flight without any warnings and email from British Airways we've found out that our seats has been moved to ""unlucky"" 13 inbound and to a 8 outbound. They've split all family quite far away apart from each other as well. Customer Service has hang up on us for the first time, and second phone call has promised to call back but never did. Will I ever over pay (£2000 difference) so I can have ""Good customer Service with British Airways ever again? - the answer is no . I am extremely upset (that our seats has been given away to someone else for no reason), disappointed and you can no longer rely on British Airways."
716,"✅ Trip Verified |  Calgary to London. Staff were not in high standards. Looked rushed and not polite, did not look professional enough. In our flight back to London staff were laughed and just chilled very loudly in back of the aircraft. There was not welcome snacks. We sat in the very last row and food choice ended. Only chicken was our option to have. Very sad and staff did not care about this situation."
717,"Not Verified |  London Heathrow to Sofia. We checked in online, so we went straight to baggage drop. It was quick and worked well, our bag was 25 kg, maximum is 23 kg, so we had to take 2 kg out. After that, we went to buy a neck cushion and we went to put our make up in bags, show our passport and then go through to security. My daughter was beeped, but it wasn't a big deal. It was fast, and our flight was departing in 1h 30m. We got some drinks, and then we noticed our gate was announced early. We headed to the gate and boarding began about 20m later. Boarding was fast, and we were sitting in seats 33 DEF. The seats were comfortable, leather and had headrests. A321 so there was no IFE. We had a 1 hour delay from the bad airspace, but eventually took off. Our route was a little different, instead of going over France, Switzerland, etc, we went over Germany, Hungary, etc. The food was good and wasn't too expensive. We didn't buy anything really, just food. While coming into Bulgaria, the views were nice. The landing was pretty good, despite the bump. Eventually we got off 1 hour late, and we went home. The verdict is that British Airways are pretty good, despite the delay."
718,"✅ Trip Verified |  Nice to Kuwait via London. My flight from Nice was delayed in the plane for 2 hours and in delayed in Heathrow for 5 hours. When we finally left the plane, there were no information on how I get another connecting flight since due to the delay I had to miss it. Then I had to pass through immigration which lasted for 2 hours. There was no one at the desk just a piece of paper with a number that says for complaints call us. Now it was 3am with no one to speak too and I still don't have my bags. I had to grab a taxi to sleep (BA didn't not provide a hotel stay). I I then had to leave the apartment at 7 am to get to the next flight with Kuwait Airways."
719,Not Verified |  Buenos Aires to London Heathrow. My wife and I flew back from Argentina on my birthday and the trip was made memorable by an air hostess (Amelia) who gave great service to everyone with her friendly professional manner. On finding out it was my birthday she came back with a complimentary drink and personal birthday card. The trip itself left on time and arrived in London early. The aircraft was quite old but we found the seats relatively comfortable. The entertainment is below standard especially the size of the screen .
720,"✅ Trip Verified |  Hong Kong to London Heathrow, this is a long haul flight operated by Boeing 777-300ER. The seat especially the headrest is quite comfortable. The legroom is large but there is a little metal box under the seat. This negatively affects the legroom. The films provided are not that many but I can see the flight path through the personal television. They provide dinner and breakfast for me. It is quite abundant but not very delicious."
721,"✅ Trip Verified |  What happened to a great airline? Got to Heathrow 1.5 hours before flight and start queuing and at one point there were only 2 operators and then after 15 minutes a 3rd appeared. 45 minutes later a BA guy asks for Vegas travellers and then asks us to go toba different line to rush things through. There was 1 operator on this line and it took another 20 minutes? Waited over 1 hour on the tarmac as we has missed our slot due to late boarding. Got to Las Vegas and waited at baggage claim for over 40 minutes, no bag. Got to BA desk to be told luggage missed plane and there should have been 2 members of staff at bag claim to tell us. No apology just a shrug of shoulders. During day receive offers from BA to upgrade to Club class and I try at least 10 times to book but website does not process. Speak to BA at 1st offer to be told offer finished despite the web advertising, get through to Manager who admits the BA website is the worst and advises to keep trying. Book in online for return and web accepts the 2 bags stated on web as 0 bags. Ring BA and they say go to airport and speak to a member of staff. Get Vegas 3 hours early to make sure plenty of time to sort and find out there are NO BA staff available in the whole airport until 2 hours before flight. What a useless organisation. I must state staff on plane very good."
722,"✅ Trip Verified |  London Heathrow to Malaga in business class. Full and very large Club Europe cabin on this morning flight. Held in the airbridge for 15 mins while boarding and not a word or reason as to why. On boarding, 2 cabin staff by entrance stood chatting amongst themselves and totally ignored customers - not a great start. Usual cabin service except the staff were not the slightest bit interested in customer service and having paid a premium for business class realised it was such a waste of money. The breakfast standards (full English) are about the same as a charter flight standard, and despite what BA shout about, this has gone through some considerable cost cutting. BA can perform well on a good day, but it seems that cabin service is getting less consistent by the day - are staff preparing to go on strike as well since that is the attitude they displayed. Male cabin staff was quite offensive to some Arabic customers in front, which was a shocker."
723,"✅ Trip Verified |  I was flying BA to Delhi in economy because my original flight with Swissair was cancelled. The 777 aircraft is looking old, the economy class seat is small and fairly cramped, the inflight entertainment is shown on small screens (films are OK, the music selection is dire and make sure you bring your own noise cancelling headphone) and the food is just OK. The flight did pretty much leave and arrive on time (allowing for the rerouting around Pakistani airspace). "
724,"✅ Trip Verified |  Seattle to Durban via London. On 24th of July i arrived late just before departure time 1330hrs, the shuttle bus picked me late from my hotel. The British airways ladies who checked me advised me to rush because the plane was about to depart. I rushed through the security thereby leaving my back pack which had all my documents. When i was rushing back to the security i met the 2 lovely ladies who had checked me in and they asked me to go up with them to the plane because it was about to leave, i panicked and they assured me that i will get my back pack in Durban. As i sat down in the plane another British airways hostess came and reassured me that i will get all my bags in Durban. On my arrival in Durban i got all my bags including my back pack! I would like to say thank you to the British Airways staff especially the 2 lovely ladies who checked me in. Its a pity i didn't get their names i was panicky. Thank you so much!"
725,"✅ Trip Verified |  London Heathrow to Austin. 10 hour flight in a Boeing 747-400. Noisy cabin, tiny screens, collapsing headrest, chocolate on my seat. Selection of just a half dozen films and no wifi. Poor food with choices running out."
726,"✅ Trip Verified |  Mykonos to London flight delayed and waiting to depart. They are not on time, be prepared to miss your connections, take off 2 hours late,. The staff is some of the worst I have had on airlines. You may be stuck on the runway and they won’t offer you any water.  The worst business class experience I have had. "
727,"✅ Trip Verified | Johannesburg to Cape Town return. This flight was operated by Comair, and thus it was quite different from a normal British Airways flight in Europe. Check in at the priority line was uneventful, however on the return the guy at the counter did not know that Oneworld Sapphire could check in at the business class counter and kept on asking if I was flying business. Johannesburg airport and Cape Town's domestic terminal is laid out very similarly. Their lounge, called SLOW is actually impressive. Although there was no full english on offer unlike the British Airways Galleries lounges in other places, there was a substantial amount of savoury snacks, pastries and small bites. They even had a coffee counter with made-to-order drinks. I assume later in the day this also becomes a bar serving alcohol. Very impressive for a domestic business class lounge. Priority boarding was honoured, and boarding was an orderly process. I would recommend anybody wanting to get an extra legroom seat to reserve row 6, as there is actually tons of legroom in front. I reserved an exit row and paid an extra £7 per exit row during the booking. These seats were old and plush, however I do prefer the newer leather seat used on their European aircraft as those offer better support. I had also noticed during boarding that their business class had slightly larger seats, in a 2x3 configuration. I did not expect this as business class in Europe is normally just a blocked middle seat. There were several drink services on this two hour flight, and a hot breakfast with either a bacon, sausage and scrambled egg option or cheese omelette with vegetables option. Needless to say, a hot meal on a two hour flight is very appreciated. It was also rather tasty and tasted quite fresh. The crew were very friendly, making casual jokes and giving a down-to-earth friendliness you rarely get on airlines these days. They were quite rushed, but understandable due to the short flight time. In Cape Town airport, it was actually quite weird to see them use both an airbridge and stairs for passengers to deplane/board. But since it took only 15 minutes to board a rather full 737, it works and makes sense. I think that this flight has improved my opinion on British Airways, and they were the same price as the competition, South African Airways. I would be very curious on my next visit to see how the two of them compare, given the fact that both are giving a near homologous product on Africa's busiest air route. For the price paid, I'd be happy to fly them again."
728,"✅ Trip Verified |  Grenada to Gatwick. Having flown with BA on this aircraft type prior to refurbishment, I was intrigued to experience the changes to the cabin. The cabin was much smarter - previous aircraft have looked very tired and the lighting was pleasant. The entertainment system was hugely improved, with a good selection of media on larger touch screen devices. I suppose the reason I appreciated this was because the old systems were so hopelessly outdated! But the family really found them entertaining. For me the real issue was the tight leg room - I am a slim 6ft 2'' and now the lack of seat width made it almost impossible to eat a meal! It was for me very tight. Previously the seat format was 3-3-3. It is now 3-4-3. We were sat in the 4 outbound although on return, we sat near the back of economy where the aircraft narrows and seats become 2-4-2. We sat in a 2, which was more bearable. I also found the seat really hard after a couple of hours although sitting on the supplied back rest cushion helped a bit! Despite best efforts to sleep, I failed..... I remember the old seats being more comfortable, especially for long haul. Service was professional and timely and food was similar to previous flights - edible. In summary, it seems a shame that BA have improved some aspects of the experience, but seat comfort has been sacrificed, which is a great pity."
729,"✅ Trip Verified |  Prague to London. A two hour flight on 27th July was delayed by 3 hours with no heads up given by BA. There was no sympathy or compensation , especially as our original flight was early morning, and with an email informing us of the delay, we could have stayed longer in the hotel. "
730,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Dubai. Lately I am frequently flying Premium Economy with British Airways. The extra comfort compared to Economy Class is unparalleled. The seat is way more comfortable, attendants are really professional and very friendly. If just could add the leg rest into all the other seats, and not just the first row (as it used to be in the old BA Premium Economy seats), then it would be perfect. That's my only note."
731,✅ Trip Verified |  Tel Aviv to Toronto via London. The plane from London to Toronto was run by Air Belgium The service from checkin until we received our cases here in Israel was excellent. The cabin staff on each airline were helpful and friendly. The food was all acceptable for economy airline food and we had snacks and on 1 flight icecream was served. Soft drinks as well as wine and alcohol was plentiful for the people that asked and water was served all during each flight. The planes had ample leg room and the seats were comfortable for economy class. Inflight entertainment was good enough there was something to watch on 4 flights. I haven't travelled British Airways for years but I will do again if the price is competitive as were these flights
732,"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew yesterday from Heathrow to Manchester in business class, from start to finish it was a shambles.  I was sent to the wrong baggage drop, then to the wrong lounge, I showed my boarding card and sent to the north lounge the furthest from the gate. The boarding process was more like a rugby scrum, no notice was taken of class of service and then my boarding card said assistance required so another queue was needed no explanation was given for this."
733,"✅ Trip Verified |  The first part from Brussels to London Heathrow was a fast flight, however on the ground in London the problems started. The gate where the arriving plane was planned to stop was not free what occurred in a waiting time on the ground for 40 minutes. The captain constantly gave information and the entire team was friendly and courteous. Continental breakfast in business was OK for this short flight. Flight to Larnaca was full, embarkation was prompt for business pax. The team was very friendly. The service started with a drink and some cookies , the meal was good despite a more substantial appetiser could be expected - a few slices of green salad and one cherry tomato is a side dish not an appetiser. It must be said the meal was an improvement since last year. Decent drinks and a good Champagne were available, followed by coffee or tea. It is a longer flight - a second round of drinks an hour before landing was maybe appropriated however it was not a problem to receive additional drinks."
734,"✅ Trip Verified |  Stockholm to London. Worst business class flight I have flown. Split seating for myself and my wife because apparently they were overbooked. The meal was inedible for me, and was the worst airline meal I have been served. "
735,"✅ Trip Verified | Seems like no one was aware of my existence on the flight. No drink, no snack, no bottle of water was offered. No amenity kits. When I asked, they said none were left in stock. They gave me toothpaste and a toothbrush, which was ok, and fast track invitation, which was useless, since no fast track is offered to British passports. I was not given a menu, I even had to ask for it. I was not served the meal and they said it was because I was sleeping. Ok fine but even when I was awake, no one bothered to ask me about the meal. I had to ask for the menu, a bottle of water, and the meal. And after all, no apologies from the staff. Too many people are squeezed into business class. Even though I could lie down 180 degrees, I had very little space at my seat. Given the very expensive fare, I expected a much better service for business class passengers. I'm very disappointed and will never use it again. I won't recommend British Airways business class to anyone!"
736,"✅ Trip Verified | Premium economy don’t waste your money on an overnight flight! Going out is acceptable but the night flight we had was a disgrace! The food (I use this term lightly) wasn’t fit for dogs on our flight, it was salmon we think as it didn’t taste of anything, a meat of some kind but was too tough to stick a fork into let alone eat it. The veg tasted burnt, bread roll was ok. (Not really a saving grace). One cup of tea or coffee at breakfast and don’t bother asking what was in the box left on our table! I didn’t bother trying it. The look on other people’s faces was good enough for me to know don’t bother! Which in comparison to the outbound flight (London to Orlando) was worlds apart, greeted with a drink which was the first of many, dinner was nice, the steak edible, veg cooked just right and dessert was nice with plenty of drinks! Inflight entertainment was good even though there was supposed to be WiFi but couldn’t log on so saved some money there. I really thought this was going to be the best way to travel. Oh a broken seat for one of our party was a bit disappointing, homeward bound and the inflight entertainment seem rather lacklustre which leads me to think it was an older plane. But that really shouldn’t happen. What is not told when booking, homeward flight on the top of your ticket if you have TSA PRE you don’t have to join the massive queue, look for pre entered TSA line that’s the one that’s empty cause they tell no one about it."
737,"✅ Trip Verified |  Lisbon to London. Business class is just economy class with an empty middle seat. No leg room for me. Meal service had no choice by the time they got halfway through business class. All that was left was cod. Freezing cold, but no blankets. Poor staff spent most of the flight apologising. Never fly British Airways. "
738,"✅ Trip Verified | Heathrow to Marseille. Within a few days of booking a flight for December, BA advised flight has been changed to late evening arrival. This is unacceptable so I opt to cancel and full refund. BA then says it is refunding the fare and makes no mention of the fee I have paid for seat selection. I have found a claim form for refund of these fees, on submission they say they will take up to 28 days to think about it."
739,"✅ Trip Verified | Madrid to London with British Airways. There is nothing left of business class on these flights. When they bring the hot towel it feels like a bad joke. Seats are the same as coach, they took forever to hang my jacket after I asked in three occasions, they gave me a sit that is considered a bad coach seat without window! (See picture) and on top of everything I find myself having to put my luggage (just a backpack) far behind my seat because they are choosing to bring the extra hand luggage that doesn’t fit anymore in coach to business class. Ridiculous service so not worth the x2.5 cost that a business class ticket goes for. Feel totally ripped off."
740,"✅ Trip Verified |  Gatwick to Glasgow. Awful experience. Our flight arrived over 2 hours late at 8.50pm, so late our car rental company was closed and we were stuck at the airport without our car. We had to pay for a taxi to our hotel and back to the airport the next day which was really expensive. Our new car hire was three times the price since it was last minute. British Airways would not help compensate because they said it wasn’t their fault."
741,✅ Trip Verified |  Frankfurt to London. BA staff watched while security went through partner's bag for around 30 mins. It required a call to police who sauntered up and stared at the bag for a while - actually just clothes. When they were finishing the flight dispatcher closed the flight. Only 1-2 minutes required. Much longer spent unloading my luggage. We had checked this bag in almost 2 hours previously and arrived at security in plenty of time.
742,"❎ Not Verified | London to Olbia. Complete confusion. The plane was delayed getting to Sardinia, and so we waited: but following check-in at Sardinia we were penned into long lines, no seats, extreme heat and no water in the queues. The airport staff in Sardinia appeared to be overwhelmed. Finally got onto the plane and we’re now delayed on the tarmac. We are due to depart more than 3 hours after our scheduled departure time, but so far still stuck on the tarmac with few updates. No water provided. I felt unwell but was told they had no glasses, so nothing to drink. Numerous small children with no hydration and high temperatures. After a second time of asking, I was told I could buy a drink once we took off, but they have no idea when that would be. They need to abandon the flight at this stage before more people become unwell. Cabin crew just standing there, doing nothing but looking perplexed"
743,"✅ Trip Verified |  Rotterdam to London City. After waiting for 6 hours at Rotterdam airport (delays) I was told they re-routed my flight to Amsterdam and that I needed to quickly catch a taxi (that I have to pay for) from Rotterdam to Amsterdam airport in the hope of catching the flight from there. As I worried I wouldn’t make it, I asked to be put in a hotel & fly the following morning but they said that was not an option as all fights are booked. There was no apology, no offer of a bus or taxis to those re-routed to Amsterdam. And throughout the process & long queue no one bothered to explain to us what was happening. Had I known we’d be re-routed to Amsterdam I would’ve left Rotterdam earlier, rather than wait in a long queue just to he told that info at the end. What a waste of time, energy & money. And no apology to make up for the hours or delay. It’s quite unbelievable. "
744,✅ Trip Verified |  Return flight to Dublin. Outbound Galleries North fine and good breakfast. Flight was fine. Return flight was delayed by 40 mins gate staff kept us informed. Lounge at Dublin was generic lounge but was ok. Staff on both flights fine. Return aircraft quite new and well presented.
745,"✅ Trip Verified |  Barbados to Gatwick. We boarded a half full flight and whilst preparing for take off the video was shown as normal, the crew participation side of it seemed like trouble to the crew. Once inflight the drinks service got under way and service was very quick I had a beer and my partner a soft drink, I was given a room temperature can and no drinking vessel and my partner her soft drink and the standard plastic cup no mention of ice. Within 20 minutes the meal service commenced they got to our seats which were 3 from the back of the aircraft and when we were served two trays appeared and passed to us, I enquired what the meal was and we were both told Pasta it’s all we have left, everyone else had a choice of chicken or pasta, my partner refused her pasta and I proceeded to challenge why on a half filled flight they had run out, no tangible answer came back but was very rudely told she would get chicken from premium economy, I said only one was required as I would eat the pasta, glad I did I think, chicken was placed on my partners tray it was burnt. During this service no further drinks were offered except for water, trays were gathered and that was the last we saw of the crew for 4 hours. They reappeared about 70 minutes before landing served a box containing stale bread with processed cheese and a stale cake, I politely refused the offering and my partner ate the bread, tea and coffee was served.  Our flight out 7 days previously was the exact opposite, pleasant staff, food standard but acceptable. The only other negative was the musical chairs played by fellow passengers, the crew turned a blind eye. The positives the IFE has a wide choice and we got home safely and getting off the aircraft was a pleasure as it was also the coldest flights I have ever been on."
746,"✅ Trip Verified |  I would like to praise the outstanding courtesy and service I received from the BA cabin crew members during my flight BA0011 from London Heathrow to Singapore on 25 June. The cabin crew were both friendly and attentive to their passengers needs, enabling them to relax & enjoy their flight. I feel very proud that British Airways continue to train their staff to such a very high standard, it really is a privilege to fly British Airways."
747,"✅ Trip Verified | Madrid to London Heathrow. This was my second trip Madrid to London on British Airways since May. On this trip like the previous the plane broke down, and we waited 2.5 hours on the plane for it to be repaired whilst the temperature outside was 42 degrees. The cabin crew director offered passengers the opportunity to purchase water and other cold drinks from the bar. Only BA could try to make money out of one of its technical failures. I then waited another hour to pick up my suitcase. As I'm a silver card holder, I could access their business lounge in Madrid. I regret using it. Fortunately, this was my last ever trip on BA."
748,"✅ Trip Verified | BA762 Heathrow to Oslo I have flown with BA a few times in the last few months, I have came off medication which makes me more nervous flying on planes, I had notified the cabin crew and they were honestly so amazing and went above and beyond for me. They had gave me a free bottle of water, kept asking if I was okay, put their arm around me, made me feel so much better. The flight was super smooth and overall an amazing service. Thanks again BA and I will be flying again with you soon!"
749,"✅ Trip Verified | Hamburg to Abu Dhabi via London Heathrow. Initial flight from Heathrow to Abu Dhabi was cancelled, had to fly a day earlier as flights on following days were cancelled as well. Service with not a free glass of water on the first leg. Abu Dhabi to London delayed by over 3hrs. A generous Dirham 20 voucher (£3,8) received from BA, which was enough for a bottle of water, or a coffee. "
750,"✅ Trip Verified | New York to Glasgow via London. A routine and smooth overnight flight that departed the gate about 45 minutes late because of a security issue at the terminal (#7). I had an electronic boarding pass on the BA app but an announcement was made that we needed to get paper versions. There was a separate desk where a couple of agents performed this task. The pilot introduced the flight attendants as “gorgeous” - which came across to me as inappropriate. I would have preferred efficient or even helpful to describe them. I had an aisle seat in a 3-3-3 seat layout. The middle seat was unoccupied. Enough leg space and storage space overhead. A good collection of all sorts of movies with free headphones provided. The IFE system was easy to use. A drink service preceded the meal service. I asked for a beer and was cheerfully offered their centenary year specially brewed IPA Brewdog Speedbird 100. Sensing that I might not enjoy it, the attendant also gave me a Heineken and a bottle of wine to accompany the dinner that followed soon thereafter. The entree choices were chicken and pasta. I chose the later. Very basic food. Tea and coffee followed. Before landing a sandwich and a drink was served. I could not figure out what was in the sandwich! The bathroom was clean. Blankets and pillows were on every seat. Alighting was quick. Landing cards have been done away with. For the fare, I paid I was satisfied - no complaints. I connected to a domestic flight to Glasgow. The announcement of the gate was made quite late. Newspapers were available at the gate - a worthy amenity. It was a smooth flight in a 3-3 seating. I was in an aisle seat, the next to me was empty. No complimentary food or drink on this segment. The two flight attendants, once the plane reached cruising altitude, put on aprons and pushed a cart down the aisle hawking edibles and elixirs. The pilot introduced them as gorgeous. Both on this and the earlier flight, a video presentation showed off the safety instructions. It was supposed to be funny and engaging. I felt it was neither - the accents of the actors were hard to understand. The flight landed on time. Overall, a positive experience but next time I will look into a non-stop flight to Glasgow from New York. The transfer at Heathrow is anxiety-inducing."
751,"✅ Trip Verified | London Heathrow to New York. The staff went above and beyond to make sure we had a wonderful experience, refreshing to see these days. The quality of food and drinks was wonderful. There was plenty of leg room as well. We would definitely fly again with BA, and are planning on making this our only airline if it flies to all of my destinations. On departure my TV did not work they tried twice to reset it for me, however this did not work. That was fine I resolved to reading my book. Just before landing our flight attendant who had be looking after us, asked if it had been rectified, I replied, no but it was ok. She came back with a bottle of Champagne, a pair of Pyjamas and a makeup bag full of goodies, not just for me but for my sister as well!! To say I was overwhelmed was an understatement! All I can say is Thank you British Airways from the bottom of my heart! The trip was for my Birthday and you certainly made it something special!"
752,"✅ Trip Verified |  Gatwick to Bermuda. Boarded very quickly and on time, Seating area smart, appearance much better than the old aircraft that normally turn up. Service very good, food was the best I have had from BA, new crockery added to the good feel and appearance, long overdue. Duvet and bedding much better and what you expect for this high-cost route, the Pillow is fabulous, gone are the small pillows and we now have a luxurious pillow you want to use. 10/10 for this flight and the crew, even though it was full up front, I hope this is a turning point for British Airways. Thank you I am looking forward to my Seychelles flight in October and my Rio flight in December, keep it coming."
753,✅ Trip Verified |  London Heathrow to Larnaca. Perfect. The early morning departure meant that Terminal 5 was unusually quiet. The Galleries Lounge offered a wide range of food and drinks in a pleasant environment. The flight took off and landed on time. The cabin crew were incredibly attentive and provided a very professional and pleasant onboard experience. Arrival procedures at Larnaca were incredibly efficient. We completed immigration and picked up our hold baggage within 30 minutes of arriving at the gate. All in all a very enjoyable trip.
754,"✅ Trip Verified |  BA 2616 and 2617 return trip from Gatwick to Cagliari. Both flights on a Saturday and were full. Aircraft was an A320-200 on both legs. Sat in row 7 outbound, 2 rows behind Club Europe. Sat in row 25 on the return, leg room seemed tighter than row 7. The brown leather seating suggested that the aircraft may have been in the BMI Fleet. Didn’t bother with the new M&S On Board service outward, but did on the return. The M&S sandwich was everything you would expect from an M&S sandwich (apart from the cost), but the coffee I had and the tea my wife had were below standard. It also took the 2 cabin crew the best part of 75 minutes to get from row 6 to row 25. The other 2 members of the cabin crew appeared to hide in Club Europe attending to just 10 passengers. Despite quite a lot of turbulence and the Seat Belt sign on for about 30 minutes, they continued to serve hot drinks and passengers were advised to be careful. You are now given a cup of hot water to add your coffee or tea bag to. Also a queue of 7 or 8 passengers requiring the toilet also formed behind the trolley, and they would not return to their seats. The rubbish from the trolley service was collected by hand as we were preparing to land. Outbound flight was fine, Inbound flight was not a great advertisement for BA. Perhaps standards at LGW are not as good as at LHR."
755,"✅ Trip Verified |  Heathrow to Kalamata. Heathrow T5 to Kalamata, Greece 8th June and return 1 week later. Used Avios points to upgrade to exit row seats for more legroom. Bad news - took off 1 1/2 hours late from Heathrow (delays to previous incoming flight) but made up about 1/2 hour on the journey out. Also left Kalamata about 1/2 hour late on our return but landed virtually on time. Seats much more comfortable with more padding than, for example, Ryanair or Jet2.com so with the extra legroom, the flights were pretty comfortable. Expensive (or course) M&S offerings for food but tasty enough. Pleasant FA's so all in all decent flights. Haven't used BA for short haul for quite a few years but would use again if the price was right."
756,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Gothenburg. Unique procedures that are not adding any order but create a lot of mess. Extra visa checks, passport checks, separate queues, additional controls. Heathrow Terminal 5 is the most bizarre."
757,"✅ Trip Verified |  Amsterdam to London on 15th April. I arrived 3 hours before flight where I waited in line for an hour while staff attended to checking people in a what seemed like a turtle paced snail like sense of urgency. After that rather lengthy delay.When I got to the gate on time, I was told the gate was shut. Thinking it must have been some kind of joke, I noted with the British Airways representatives saying that I was on time. She replied yes but you were the last person, everyone had made it before me, my bags were already offloaded she continued to say.  After asking what do I do now? Not having the ability to ring abroad I asked if they could help me which they replied saying there is no Qantas office in Amsterdam and they cannot help me. "
758,"✅ Trip Verified |  Istanbul to London. My first flight in Economy is the new A321 Neo, The aircraft is set up with the first 15 rows of regular seats and the remaining 17 rows of the new extra slim economy seats. The seat does not recline, is very thin and OK for an hour flight. However 3 hours 45 minutes flight it became pretty uncomfortable after 2 hours. The 5 members of the cabin crew were great serving the usual MS for sale products."
759,"✅ Trip Verified |  I had some difficulty from the start, after my initial booking the website repeatedly asked me to log in, even though I was already logged in. I wanted to reserve seats and request special meals. It took me 2 days to achive this. I was amazed by the cost of reserving ordinary seats, no extra legroom, this bumped the price up for 4 people by £328 and seats were only booked on the LHR-KUL and return KUL-LHR legs. I had difficulty checking in using the BA app and eventually did it using Malaysia Airlines app. Checking in online was only allowed 24hrs before making things a little awkward being in Kuching for our return leg with an 8 hr time difference. I was looking forward to flying on the Boeing 787 but it really is just a dream. Food choices we were told ran out at breakfast, the choice was full English or just an omelette, but the full English ran out or so we were told, but looking over my shoulder a few minutes later and another trolley had appeared with the full English on it. Earlier meals were ok with beer, wine and other drinks available. There was very little attention by cabin crew between main meals and we had to go to the rear galley to ask for water. For an over 12h flight, I think the cabin should at least be visited 2-3 times. Toilets were clean and worked ok and the aircraft as a whole was clean and tidy. The IFE selection was superb with many of the latest films available along with games and music. Our return flight from KL to London was very cold, the Boeing 787 has no way of changing the airflow to your seat."
760,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Dusseldorf. No free drinks or food, which is pretty normal for short haul flights. Crew was pretty average Seat was average. Ground crew was pretty nice. No inflight entertainment. "
761,"✅ Trip Verified | London to Seoul. Nightmare experience with British Airways almost constantly. My Business cabin is downgraded to economy at the last minute with a 12 hours long-hauls flight! Lounge simy sucks, cheap, noisy and croweed. Multiple malfunction items on the aircraft including unfolded table. Given the price it Charge, certainly one of the worst airlines one can possible take."
762,"Not Verified |  London to Vancouver. Economy was a lot more cramped than I expected. BA had crammed seats in. Crew were okay. Food reasonable really although I had upgraded my food which came before everyone else had theirs which was a shame. Flew back premium class, more room. I probably won’t use them in November when I go back. Timing was good and air quality felt ok as I didn’t get a headache."
763,"❎ Not Verified | Newcastle to Delhi via London. At check-in , I was charged for carrying 2.8 kilos extra, which is of no problem. I paid a total of £65 for 2.8 kilos. On my flight from London to Delhi, during boarding I asked for water to which the attendant told she would get but she was busy as customers were boarding the flight. I then  asked for a bottle of water  which she seemed to forget.  2 hours into the  journey, my in-flight entertainment system got stuck on the TV and Radio feature. When the dinner was served, Ithe meal consisted of chicken gravy and mash, along with bread butter and a mousse. Delays caused by British Airways resulted in the flight reaching Delhi late and me missing my connecting flight. But as I landed at Delhi and picked my baggage from the belt, a British Airways staff was ready with another ticket from Delhi to Mumbai without me even asking. "
764,"✅ Trip Verified |  Miami to Delhi via London.  The BA business class I flew for the first time recently was the worst I have  flown. Whereas most have four seats across British Airways has eight! The lay down beds are hard, thin and short. Not worth the money."
765,"Not Verified |  London to Sydney via Singapore. Checked in with a bag which was 23.4kg. My allowance was 23kg. I was made to repackage the bag and take two pairs of shoes out and place them in my hand luggage, really? I found the food on both legs of the flight horrible."
766,"✅ Trip Verified |  Phoenix to Amsterdam via London. It was 10 hrs on a delayed flight, in a cramped seat with no lights, no call light. No entertainment of any sort, and food I found exceptionally bad. The B747 that was terribly maintained. The offer of 20.GBP for compensation is insulting and further exemplifies a lack of concern for your passengers comfort and safety."
767,"✅ Trip Verified |  Standard, run of the mill airline for today's economy. Flew Tel Aviv to New York, with a two hour layover in London Heathrow. Crew was fine, entertainment system on the London to New York leg was very nice. The special meal I ordered was not on either of the two flights. I  called them two and a half weeks prior to departure to check that the meals were in the system, and was assured they were. I submitted a complaint to ba.com and the responses I received were lame and unacceptable. Not a stitch of good will was forthcoming from British Airways, as I suggested topping off my Avios balance to a mere 5000 points (my balance is around 3500). "
768,"✅ Trip Verified |  Belfast City to Atlanta via London Heathrow T5. Check-in was fairly smooth at Belfast as it was early in the morning. However, when the agent called me over the check me in, he was all flustered that I wasn't an elite Executive Club member although my boyfriend had just checked in with the same agent without any difficulty. I knew he was working the premium line, but nobody was standing in it, and I was standing in the regular line when he called me. After about 20 minutes, I finally got a boarding pass to go through security. The flight from BHD to LHR was uneventful and bare-bones, as nothing was served for free on the flight. My boyfriend therefore hated it, as we're used to getting better service on American in the US, but I was fully aware that BA had turned itself into a glorified EasyJet. Once we arrived to LHR, I continued by myself to Atlanta on BA and was shocked at the crowded, user-unfriendly T5. Although I suppose it was pretty in some ways, I had to sit in one of the dank cattle pits they hold people in until their flight is called, so it felt very crowded and hot. After my flight was called, I found myself on a crowded shuttle to the plane with pushy people. Boarding was straightforward, however, and the flight attendants were very polite and helpful to customers, even in economy. The flight product was just OK in my view. I had an exit row aisle seat, and while I had extra room and a nice headrest, the seat was right by the lav, so it stank. IFE was fine with a decent selection, but it was not as complete as Delta's. The food was the bland equivalent of what Delta serves, so no brownie points there, and the ""tea"" service they had was terrible: we were given half-sandwiches in plastic wrap without a tray and then only with a limited selection of beverages. I remember years ago when BA was a premium carrier and served very nice things to its passengers with a friendly smile. Those smiles have disappeared for the most part, and the feeling of flying a special carrier is no longer there. However, I arrived on time and promptly got my bag. The 777 was also nice and spacious and the flight attendants were polite, so I might fly them again, though I would not recommend BA due to the crowds and discomfort I experienced at T5."
769,"✅ Trip Verified |  Buenos Aires to London. I wish to thank the crew that was so nice to me while I was terribly sick. Wish I knew their names! They gave me medicine, a blanket and caressed my back while I was crying from the stomach ache. Forever grateful."
770,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Nashville. The worst airline Trans-Atlantic. Despite looking forward to flying on this new route to Nashville, British Airways ruined this trip. The flight was delayed by over three hours, whilst they ostensibly replaced the damaged aircraft with an inbound Boeing 787-9 from San Jose. The airplane was filthy dirty in Club Class, which is bad enough having to suffer the awful, dated, Club Class ying-yang facing, narrow seats with divider. Business Class on British Airways is the worst of any airline. The WIFI was out of service. On late arrival in Nashville, my luggage arrived soaking wet, and I was unable to change clothes. On my return to the UK, I contacted British Airways Customer Relations to seek compensation, and got the usual pathetic, mainly computer generated, insincere apology. I am now forced to haggle with British Airways, and endure their woeful so-called Customer Relations department. It is a real shame to witness the decline of this national carrier. British Airways treat their premium class customers with contempt. This is what happens when an airline has a monopoly from Heathrow. "
771,✅ Trip Verified |  Flight was delayed by almost two hours and it was nice when they gave us the only Boeing 747-400 that was in old BOAC retro colours the seats where wide and comfortable plenty of storage the IFE was average food was good and in generous portions but what stood out was the high level of service and friendliness!
772,"✅ Trip Verified | Just checked in for a flight from Newcastle with BA. The check in process was disgusting. 45 minutes queuing. 2 BA staff working in two desks, one of which was a virtually empty priority queue in which the female checking assistant spent a large proportion of her time chatting to a colleague from Air France in the adjacent desk! The process was ridiculously slow with each check in taking several minutes. When the priority queue representative deigned to check economy passengers, she seemed to take an eternity. In the 45 minutes it took us, the queue never dropped below about 100 people. I have never queued in a slower or more disorganised check in desk. The adjacent Jet2 desks had seven staffed desks and I counted 14 staff! The “welcome” sign displayed at the BA desk should have been located at the start of the queue with the additional wording of “you’re in for a long wait”. To cap it all, after enduring the queue, we’re now delayed 40 minutes thus far! So unprofessional!"
773,"✅ Trip Verified |  Gatwick to Madrid. When I arrived I waited for one and a half hours for my one suitcase. It didn’t arrive.  I was asked to fill in a ‘lost luggage’ form which I did and given a number to call the next day. The representative said she’d make sure the suitcase was delivered by 5.00 p.m. I was out during the day. When I returned later that evening there was no suitcase. It hadn’t been delivered. The next morning (Sunday) I phoned the number again. The answer message said phone back on Monday. As I was leaving on Sunday night this was pointless. I was leaving Madrid at 8.30 pm. My one suitcase arrived two hours before I left Madrid. So I spent the whole time in Madrid without my medicines, change of clothes, toiletries etc which ended up wasting a lot of my (short, valuable) time buying essentials that I needed whilst there."
774,"✅ Trip Verified |  My boyfriend and I wanted to return from our trip to London a day early but the BA app and website continued to glitch so I called to ask how much it would be to leave a day earlier. I was told that the penalty fee for changing the flight is $275 each and there’s a $50 fee for them to do it over the phone that’s $600, and the price of a flight by itself. We decided to try our luck again changing it on the app and paid $550 to change our flight to one day earlier to make it back for an event. The flight was delayed and arrived 1hr 55 mins late. We missed our event. The plane was filthy and my tv didn’t work. I asked the flight attendant for something to clean the slimy finger smears off the screen with and she told me it’s normal wear and tear but I could get toilet paper from the bathroom. I called to ask for a refund for the fees since the flight was delayed but they told me they can’t give us a refund because we got on the flight."
775,"✅ Trip Verified |  I had kept my laptop bag in the overhead cabin. Somebody got in a bigger cabin bag and they couldn't fit the bag in the space remaining, so they kept the bag on my laptop bag. When I asked the flight attendant to help me with this, he asked me to keep my luggage down.  I was travelling with only one laptop bag, placed it in the cabin right over my seat and instead of asking the oversized bag to be placed properly or kept it elsewhere, my bag which was in place before the oversized bag came in was asked to be moved out. How fair is this? "
776,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Delhi. A truly first class experience from check in to landing. I am a frequent flyer with BA and have not always had an amazing experience, this one was. Check in was easy and swift and the Concorde Room was excellent. The flight itself was wonderful, while I accept it isn’t the best first class cabin in the skies the service is second to none. The cabin crew were friendly greeting us by name and showing us personally to our seats. Throughout they ensured we were very well looked after without them being overbearing. New soft product is very good and food definitely much improved. "
777,"✅ Trip Verified |  London Heathrow to Dubai. Last Sunday we unfortunately missed our BA flight to Dubai due to unforeseen circumstances, so we booked the next available flight for the morning which was with Emirates. Today we arrived at Dubai airport expecting to board the flight home that we had already paid for months in advance. At check in the BA staff told us that our flight had been cancelled as we missed our outgoing flight. We have not received a refund for the seats and they have refused to refund us the tickets we had brought. "
778,"Not Verified |  London to Seattle. My husband and I have used this service for a number of years as our son lives in America. We have always been very satisfied with the service. Unfortunately I was taken ill on this flight and the service went from good to superb! I’d like to thank the cabin crew and Captain for the care I received during the last two hours of the flight. Advice was sought via radio, I was made comfortable in the galley, at least one crew member with me at all times, given oxygen etc. paramedic boarded the plane and escorted me off when I was then given a thorough medical check, a wheel chair was waiting and we were fast tracked through customs as I was not well enough to walk to the car park. We met the crew at the lift and the captain came to ask how I was. Many thanks to all of the and apologies to passengers that I must have disturbed."
779,"✅ Trip Verified |  Johannesburg to London. I booked a seat without luggage. Firstly one cannot make one booking for two passengers if only one has luggage. This caused an issue when trying to seat together. When the passenger without luggage tried to move seats (normally a free option for standard seats), you get advised that you have to pay. This was not disclosed when the booking was made. It was irritating because one of us was ill. "
780,✅ Trip Verified |  London to Milan. Evening outbound flight with some on board space so middle seat was empty. Boarding by group number worked effectively and I was able to store my laptop in the overhead. Free newspapers were available in the jet way. Passengers were warmly greeted. I was one row behind emergency exit and despite numerous requests from the steward woman in front was very challenging in agreeing to have her bag stored in the overhead which the steward handled very politely and patiently. Usual on board trolley service which I didn't use. Flight departed 10 minutes late due to lengthy taxi way and due to a head wind arrived in Linate 20 minutes late. Return flight could have been a challenge due to Italian strike but the very full flight departed on time and landed 15 minutes early. The cabin crew on this flight were excellent especially the senior stewardess who was warm and friendly towards every single customer - outstanding. We were taken off the aircraft and bussed into T5 which I think actually saved time as the entrance is directly below passport control. All in all a couple of very good flights.
781,"✅ Trip Verified |  The connecting flight to Johannesburg was on an older 737-400 with proper business class seats and lots of legroom. Pre-take off drinks offered and a decent meal for a short flight. Everything went smoothly and service was good. Boarding for the main flight was on time and proceeded smoothly, we were seated on the upper deck in the forward cabin. Much has been said about the BA ying-yang seat configuration. The seats are narrow, and there is a lack of privacy for the aisle seat, with probably the main complaint being lack of storage for personal items around the seat. However the seat is very comfortable in any position, and the White Company bedding is excellent. We had an aisle / centre seats at the rear of the cabin, which worked well as a couple with the privacy screen left down. The centre seat does have a shelf for personal belongings, and access from this seat does not require stepping over another passenger. The service on this flight was superb, from the welcome on boarding and continuing throughout the flight - very efficient, quick to respond, and super friendly. Preflight champagne or fruit juice was offered as soon as we were seated, with a bar service as soon as the seat belt light was off. There was a choice of 4 starters, 3 mains, and 3 sweets or cheeseboard, with a decent choice of wines. Breakfast offered a good choice, although we were happy with just the fruit, yoghurt, and bread. There could be no complaints in respect of catering. The A380 is a super aircraft and very quiet, but without doubt the major feature of this flight was the fantastic crew. Our connecting flight to Leeds was good, but compared with our South African flight it was noticeable that this was economy class seats and spacing with just an empty middle seat. It is a short flight, but there was still a full meal service. The only poor aspect on this trip was arrival in Leeds. The airport seems quite run-down, escalator not working, and few staff to be seen. There was only one other arrival, but we still waited over 30 minutes for luggage to come through."
782,"✅ Trip Verified | London Heathrow to Los Angeles. Very nice experience. I read other reviews slamming BA but that was not the experience we had. From the check in to the lounge and on board the flight our experience was fantastic. Crew on the flight was outstanding and very attentive. Food was good, not great, but very good. Seats worked well and comfy (more on that in the seat review). Again, the flight crew and make or break the experience and this crew hit a home run. In flight entertainment worked well but was not streaming with I like over the monitors. AA does a very good job on this One World route as well but I would take BA over AA if you can but both airlines do a good job on these longer hauls."
783,"✅ Trip Verified | CPT is definitely getting its act together: BA's Galleries Lounge is spacious with a good selection of food and staff actually managed to make the group boarding work for once. The upper deck is still one of the better bets when flying in Club World. That's despite the ancient yin/yang seats and the tiny IFE screen with appalling resolution. The new bedding certainly helps cushion the hard seats and the large pillow actually feels luxurious. The dinner service was according to the new CW 'soft' design, which meant delays while plates were brought out to passengers individually. On the whole, I think it works and having the 'triple bread' roll already on the tray means that the bread is there when you want it, rather than served with the dessert. Breakfast has been streamlined, too, and staff actually paid attention to the request cards filled in before takeoff. Apart from some inevitable turbulence, the flight went according to plan and we touched down 30 minutes ahead of schedule. A good flight, overall, but an old style business class experience."
784,"✅ Trip Verified |  Sofia to Belfast via London. The legroom on the Sofia to Heathrow flight was terrible. I am not tall, but my knees were pushing against the seat in front.  Service was non existent unless you want to pay inflated prices. Where did the service go? There was a bad delay on the Belfast flight.  We were not allowed to re-enter the lounge when the plane developed a fault, as we had gone through security.  Only after 40 minutes were we allowed to re-enter the lounge. Service announcement was chaotic and contradicted what BA was sending us via texts. The delay lasted 2 hours 55 minutes, just short enough to avoid compensation. The Belfast flight had a lot more legroom than the 3-hour flight from Sofia.  I will never set foot on this airline again. "
785,"✅ Trip Verified |  Lima to Gatwick. Helpful and courteous cabin crew.  The seat was uncomfortable and the in flight entertainment system derisory. The screen was small and in poor condition. Movies shown in the in flight magazine were unavailable and the selection of movies was poor. The touch screen failed to respond correctly and at times occasionally, without warning, increased the sound level to maximum without touching the screen or handset. A 12 hr flight with a rubbish entertainment system."
786,"✅ Trip Verified | Inverness to Auckland via Singapore with British Airways. Service was very good but comfort was very bad, for a 14 hour I had no more leg room than I did for an hour flight. I was uncomfortable and as a regular flyer I have used other airlines that provide much more space for long haul flights."
787,"✅ Trip Verified | I was seated right next to the galley and lavatory in the aisle. During the safety talk the cabin crew were only metres away talking loudly which was irritating, so my initial impression was disappointed for business class. However, into the flight I found one female crew very personable and was offered a seat two back. I was not provided with a complimentary travel wallet, so did not realise that socks and sleep mask were available, and I needed to ask for a pillow. The menu guide was on cheap paper and, with no convenient place to store it for reference later, was very ordinary. The evening meal was acceptable (soup, steak/veg, fruits ) was OK served with freezing cold cutlery. Bed was ok but nowhere to store spectacles or personal needs such as spectacles, asthma puffer, or water bottle. The breakfast of juice and cereal/yoghurt was fine but the single poached egg was like a rubber ball and the included fish patties were unpalatable. The lavatory was spacious and allowed room to change clothes ready for the connecting flight. Overall I expected a better level of attention to detail and a more upmarket delivery. The only business class addition feature that I appreciated was being able to stretch out for some sleep. BA ground staff were unable to link my second flight on a QF 11 from Singapore to Brisbane, insisting I needed to collect my luggage, leave arrivals and recheck in for next flight. I am 73 with some mobility problems, requiring assistance, so this was a worry for me. When I arrived in Singapore, the kind assistance girl arranged to take me to a special transit desk where it was no problem arranging for my bags to be forwarded to next flight."
788,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flight was OK, minor delay didn't both me. What was astonishing is that we had to wait an hour or so to drop off our luggage because at Lyon Airport they were training new ground staff at the same time? They continued doing this even though the cue became pretty huge and time started to run out to make it to the flight."
789,"✅ Trip Verified |  
Gatwick to Barbados return. I normally travel on BA with low expectations with the result that I am not too disappointed and sometimes pleasantly surprised. The outbound flight was about par for the course with a reasonably comfortable seat and an OK cabin crew that did just about enough to look after us and make the flight uneventful. However, the flight did leave bang on time and managed to land in Barbados before the Virgin flight that was scheduled to leave Gatwick five minutes before us, with the result that we got through arrivals quickly. The return flight a week later managed to reinforce my low expectations of BA with one of the poorer flights that we have experienced over the last few years. Once again when you travel west to east, the crew (specifically one lady who was looking after our part of the cabin) somehow feel they have to rush through every part of the drinks and meal service that it becomes an ordeal. The pre departure drinks were missed on all of seats on the left hand side of the PE cabin (not a big deal but irritating non the less). No bread was served with dinner, despite there being butter on the plate, so I presume it was missed. My wife had ordered a veggie meal and was served about ten minutes before everyone else, which was fine. However, as the crew were serving the remaining meals, there was a continual dialogue across the two aisles about what selections they each had on their respective trolleys. When they reached our row, they somehow thought it would be a good idea to try and pass a hot tray of chicken in gravy across the four middle seats with the result that the red hot gravy spilled on the my wife's remaining food and lap, although fortunately she did have a napkin in place which absorbed most of the liquid. It also spilled on my Kindle which thankfully had the cover closed. A very brief apology was given but without any sincerity and I suspect blissfully unaware of the obvious mistake they had made. My wife's wine was replaced but not the rest of her dinner. Once again we landed on time, which was a good thing. Overall, the return flight was extremely poor."
790,"✅ Trip Verified |  Marseille to London. I am generally annoyed with the quality of the service. I believe that we should not have to pay for a glass of water with slice of lemon in a BA flight. I realised that I forgot a big duty free bag in the plane after the passport control. I went to the BA Helpdesk, the staff sent me to terminal 5 at the lost and found to pick up my bag while it was not even there. Luckily, I decided to stop on the way in the lost and found of terminal 3, where they (the friendly lost and found staff and not the BA staff) nicely explained me that there was no point for me to go there and called some other agents to help me. "
791,"✅ Trip Verified |  The cabin crew on flight BA035 London to Chennai were very efficient and did their best to take care of their clients. I did tell them I would write a review and here it is. Keep up the good service and, thanks!"
792,"✅ Trip Verified |  Gatwick to Malaga. Check in was fairly quick. The check in area at Gatwick is quite nice although they are failing with general upkeep. The whole area needed vacuuming and there were stains and signs of chewing gum on the carpets. If you’re not going to look after it then you better just having normal airport flooring. The lounge at Gatwick is really nice and whilst it was very busy, there were still available comfy and desk style chairs to suit. The food and drink offering was very good. Tasty and varied. On board I was lucky to be able to book the exit row, which actually makes the seats better than club in my opinion. Food and drinks service was fairly slow although being near the front this wasn’t a problem for me. The food offering is fairly poor really, a couple of sandwiches or snacks.. drinks selection is better. What was very nice was, near the end of the flight I was given a free glass of champagne for being a silver member. I wouldn’t expect this, and I’m sure it’s just because they had a bottle to use up, but it was a nice gesture to show to frequent flyers. Still no WiFi or WiFi based in flight entertainment offered. Priority bag tags as usual are kind of irrelevant. My bag took quite a long time to come through and was preceded by dozens of non priority bags. Overall a decent flight, and very good value as I paid using avios. Being silver and getting lounge access and free seat selection was a massive plus."
793,"✅ Trip Verified |  Boston to London Heathrow, was excited to experience A380 for the first time. Paid a steep $91 for the seat selection on the upper deck. Was very comfortable with storage cabin beneath the Window. Seat itself was the standard one, comfortable. The boarding was efficiently managed for such a large aircraft. There was never a massive crowd in front of the gate. The inflight service for the outbound leg was less than ideal. The food was very mediocre at best - not worth losing sleep over it. There was serious bumps along the way midflight. The A380 being so massive easily absorbed it. Return was on a B777 - flight was not full but almost full. The inflight service and the food served were both remarkably better than the outbound journey. The baggage drop area however was a disaster. None of the machines worked and there was single kind hearted person assisting passengers. The boarding was again very orderly. Both outbound and inbound IFE was good but not as good as some long haul carriers. If both legs had similar cabin crew and food I would have scored them higher. "
794,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Cape Town in First and our first taste of the new 'soft' product. Still, unfortunately, a 30 year-old 747 that hadn't had its refurbishment and was showing its age. A wardrobe door that's falling off its hinges, a non-touch touch screen and a cupboard door in the washroom that won't stay shut don't pass muster in First and blemish the impression of the positive changes in the on-board service. The young mixed fleet crew did a reasonable job and served drinks and food efficiently without the wait other reviewers have complained about. Care was also taken in preparing and plating up the food. For once, nothing was overcooked and even the beef was decent. Bedding is also improved, with a good quality duvet and large pillow. The IFE remains the same low-res screen quality and the new headphones are uncomfortable worn for more than the duration of a single film. The goodies bag is much better and worth taking home. Overall, a pretty good flight, but it remains to be seen what BA will do with its long-in-the-tooth First Class when their new Club Suites are launched."
795,"✅ Trip Verified |  This review is specifically aimed at the excellent cabin crew on BA 174 from JFK New York to Heathrow on Tue 14th May. I was travelling back from New York following a few days break with 11 girlfriends. Check in and boarding was all on schedule,however it was identified that there was a technical problem and the captain advised passengers that some assistance was required to rectify the issue; this resulted in over an hour's delay leaving NY. Despite this annoying delay, the cabin crew more than made up for this. They were friendly, polite and couldn't do enough to ensure our journey was comfortable and enjoyable, they were all exceptional, even those that were not serving in the section I was in. I do hope that this information is passed on."
796,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Aberdeen. Before boarding the flight I was forced to check in my bag at the gate because apparently the flight was full and I was boarding in Group 5. I was traveling with the permitted allowance and discussed with the lady at the Boarding Gate. I saw people boarding with Tax free bags on top of the other bags. Being almost the last on the plane, there was free spaces to accommodate bags. I was not happy because I had the permitted allowance. "
797,"✅ Trip Verified |  Gatwick to Dubrovnik. Overcrowded lounges, business class seats same as economy with middle seat empty. LGW lounge opens one hr before some EU flights in morning only and met by a large queue. And now frequent flyers don’t get free baggage anymore on long haul cheap tickets."
798,"✅ Trip Verified |  I paid an extra £500 for two Premium economy seats on this long haul flight and was very disappointed. The seat felt small and was shabby, the tv screen was small and very dark. I tried to adjust it but it was still unwatchable. The whole experience was very poor, not Premium in any way. The return flight was a code share with Japan Airines which was Premium, a whole different experience. I would be happy to pay for their Premium seats. I would advise avoid British Airways Premium economy as it is far from Premium. I felt a complete waste of £500."
799,✅ Trip Verified |  Faro to Heathrow. Flight was very good no issues at all but yet again baggage collection was a disaster. We fly club or first all the time and without fail the baggage is always last off. Spoke to BA desk and they were clueless and had no idea why this happens or how to stop it and correct it. Same happened on flight out too. It is a shambles and a disgrace. Waited 39 mins got cases at Heathrow and this is unacceptable will kit be using them again. Avoid at all costs.
800,"✅ Trip Verified | Vancouver to London. An excellent flight on BA. I travel this route several times a year and generally BA are much better than AC, Especially on this flight, BA were way ahead of the competition. Seats comfortable, food pretty good for economy, decent wine and the in flight crew, simply outstanding. Professional, smiling, friendly. They embodied BA at their very best."
801,"✅ Trip Verified |  Gatwick to Tenerife. All so wrong. Lounge really overcrowded / food on the plane pretty horrid, left most of it. Paid for and travelling Business Class and allocated four rows away from my partner,  this is normal procedure. Apparently on top of a £2000 six night holiday I should have paid another hundred pounds plus to sit with my partner - total madness. This is an airline with a self destruct button, such a shame.Have just booked Norwegian for our next flights to Barcelona and Buenos Aires, did not even bother to look at BA."
802,"✅ Trip Verified | Washington to London. Having travelled out to Washington from Heathrow on 23/04/19 First Class I wasn't overly impressed. Although the Concorde Room was relaxing and comfortable, the bar staff were a mixture of attentive and somewhat dismissive. The cabin crew were polite but quite surgical in their manner which gave an overall impression of a cold and clinical approach. My return journey couldn't have been more different. The BA lounge was very well presented with a fantastic choice of both food and drink but the hi-light of my return flight were the engaging nature of the cabin crew. Nothing short of amazing. I was offered the usual amenities upon boarding but what set this flight apart from the start was the very happy and friendly nature of the crew. Absolutely nothing was too much trouble and they took the time to chat with me and showed a real general interest in what we talked about. Demeanour was perfect with both a very professional yet relaxing and engaging approach. A fantastic sense of humour and seemed genuinely delighted to assist. Having had mixed levels of service with BA and always flying Virgin I think BA need to track down this staff member and use her as the model for all future cabin crew training."
803,"✅ Trip Verified | Rome Fiumicino to London City. A BA Cityflyer service. No wait to check in. Aircraft was not full. We pushed back early and arrived early. This route still has complimentary refreshments in economy, including wine – a great bonus and pleasant surprise. Cabin service was pleasant and professional. A really excellent flight."
804,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Shanghai. The most disappointing business class I have flown in a long time. The plane was old, worn and dirty (there were crumbs of food on the seat and the floor from a previous flight), It took 2 hours to for drinks service to reach my seat after take off - the food followed shortly, which was over cooked. They seemed to be short on staff. However, what made me really angry was that there were people in the cabin who had had both drinks and food and were having their beds turned down before I’d even been offered a drink. The service was exceptionally poor. I am flying home tomorrow and am not looking forward to the flight. As a Gold card holder, you might have thought BA would check their frequent fliers are being looked after? I’ll return to using other airlines in the one world group for my long haul trips, such as Cathay, JAL or Finnair. The only reason that I’ve given more than one star is that I managed to sleep quite well - the bedding and pillows were good. Ultimately though - sorry BA, not good enough."
805,"✅ Trip Verified | Their customer service is horrible. Lost our bags. Here we sit in London after 2.5 days of wearing the same clothing. We fly out in 3 hours to Barcelona for a 14 day cruise and have pretty much lost any hope of being reunited with our bags before we go. I spent so much $$$ on this trip to celebrate my husbands 60th birthday and our 5th wedding anniversary. It was supposed to be our trip of a lifetime. We have really been trying to make light of things, but not getting our bags today, as it's now Friday and we left on Tuesday AM from Seattle, is heartbreaking. Not one single person at British Airways has handled this with any kind of urgency or empathy, for that matter. One customer service agent even asked me if we would be OK getting out to Heathrow to ""pick them up."" Truly the worst customer experience I've had."
806,"✅ Trip Verified |  London City to Zurich, I fly this route a lot, around 8 times per year, The flight was delayed initially by an hour, I was kept up to date via the app so I was not disappointed. Around 45 minutes into the flight one of the crew member came over with a card in his hands wishing me a Happy Birthday followed by a bottle of Champagne, Brandy etc, this was totally unexpected, it made my day. Thanks to the crew."
807,"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked a flight from Bucharest to London and return and when we were at the airport, they informed us that the flight will be delayed for 5 hours (from 8am to 1pm), then another 1 hour and a half (until 2:30 pm). We lost the money we paid for the bus tickets and they would not refund. Returning to Bucharest our flight was delayed and they did not  inform us about it. I understand that unforeseen situation can happen, but I have never seen such a poorly prepared company in my life."
808,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Calgary. Thank you to James, a Club World flight attendant on BA 0103 April 15, 2019. His service was impeccable, attentive and delightful. I thoroughly enjoyed the flight. "
809,"✅ Trip Verified |  Vancouver to London, we were upgraded to business class at the airport. The staff were absolutely delightful and had a fabulous trip. Really they could not have been more helpful and I would recommend them. "
810,"Not Verified |  
Miami to London Heathrow with British Airways. Top deck of 747 with one experienced and one new crew members. Perfect welcome and appreciated the method of selecting what and when to have for breakfast. Had a starter and then settled down and slept better than expected. On-time arrival and AA Arrivals lounge was quiet with good showers."
811,"✅ Trip Verified |  Houston to London. The plane left an hour late while an engineer dealt with a problem. I’ve no problem with that, I like travelling safely. I thought, well I’m sure I’d booked an aisle seat online but it appears it was a window. I missed out on the airline meal and when I realised I buzzed the steward and requested a sandwich and water, explaining the problem. He fetched me a sandwich and various bits he’d scrabbled together from the kitchen. Later when the liquid refreshment cane round, both my neighbour and I requested water and I had to reach across him for my drink as he helped himself to his drink and left me to it."
812,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Delhi. The worst business class trip for us. Seats much smaller than business class on Singapore Air, Thai International, Eva Air, Qantas; Not seated together - same surname, Mr and Mrs - but moved after. No privacy on middle seats; one tiny drawer is only storage for shoes, iPad, makeup and sponge bag, book etc. Film/TV selection was very limited and my choice wasn’t working. The food was very poor - main course congealed and so basic with a dessert that was pathetic, no tea, coffee, or chocolates offered to us. Breakfast had no jam with the croissant. Nobody came round during the flight offering extra water or other beverages. The crew didn’t put themselves out. If one pays more for business class one expects more and we didn’t get it. I would never choose to travel BA again."
813,"✅ Trip Verified |  Bucharest to London. My flight with British Airways was 7 hours delayed (from a European destination to London). I applied for compensation for this delay. Initially I was informed that under EU regulations I would receive 400 Euros compensation, to be informed 4 days later that this was an error and that I was no longer getting compensated. British Airways argued that sickness of a crew member is considered extraordinary circumstances (comparable with weather issues) and that therefore, they do not have to compensate passengers for this flight. However, there are court precedence cases that clearly show that crew sickness is not to be considered an extraordinary circumstance and that it is in an airlines responsibility to have a contingency strategy for such cases or compensate if they do not. I have talked to the manager of customer service and was told that there is nothing they can do as this is their policy. I believe that, if not on legal basis, British Airways should have compensated out of customer service reasons because a 7 hour delay (within Europe) is significant. Many times I picked to fly with British Airways based on the expectations of good customer service in the case of anything going wrong. But this experience proved to me that it's not worth investing that extra money into flying with British Airways."
814,✅ Trip Verified |  London Heathrow to Bengaluru. I found the crew very friendly and even humorous! Whenever the airhostesses passed through the aisle (I was on a seat next to the aisle) we would exchange some friendly comments which almost always lead to muffled laughs!  One air hostess admitted that she enjoyed such conversations which made the stress of her work lighter! 
815,"Not Verified |  Madrid to London. We paid for business class and then paid for specific seats. The original booking was from Iberia (part of IAG which operates BA, Iberia and Air lingus) BA clearly do not integrate into Iberia's systems since after paying for and closing our seats, upon checking in we found our seats had been changed by BA (these flights were operated by Iberia and BA, BA being the return leg from Madrid to London Heathrow). BA explained that they would have to check if we were due a refund - total joke since we paid for the seats. Additionally the BA said the flight was full and could not change the seats. No explanation as to why we paid for specific seats in business and they were changed by BA without notice. We'll accept the refund on this occasion since there is nothing else we can do and never use BA or Iberia again which is a shame since Iberia CS has always reflected all and IAG / BA has let the customer down, again. Just simply poor BA  and low bar as always, expected more for full fare business class. Rated 1/10 since as we were let down and did not receive an explanation and were initially told that we would not get a refund on the paid for allocated seats!"
816,✅ Trip Verified |  Dublin to London Heathrow. British Airways offered a very good overall service on this flight. I booked online and found that process very easy. The caveat was not being able to select the seat I wanted ahead of travel without paying another fee. The check-in lady was very friendly and helpful and gave a good account of herself. The flight departed on-time and the captain made frequent announcements. Within the previous two weeks I had flown with BA twice within Europe and this flight was by the best of the 3 thanks to the staff. The flight was relatively short but well managed with a nice drop down map and staff visibly make a real effort. One curiosity was the staff handing out UK landing cards The flight was punctual and reliable.
817,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Seattle. My seat was on the upper deck, a nice perk for Seattle flights to Europe (BA is the only one flying 747s to Europe from Seattle). Overall the product is outdated. Service was not at the level it used to be. Staff is polite and professional but they keep the service to a minimum.  Upper deck crew on this flight was mainly uninterested except the bare minimum.  No additional service, no top ups, not offering water during the flight. Of course if you ask for something you do get it. There was also a lot of traffic on the stairway connecting upper and lower deck with the crew congregating at the lower deck.  I hope BA will improve their act. I certainly won’t use their services in foreseeable future."
818,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Gibraltar. Check in at T3 was fine, lounge was good and staff were more proactive than was previously the case. Flight was good with decent lunch served including the kids meals which were fine. Skilled landing in Gibraltar- a good flight"
819,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Boston. BA replaced A380 with a very old Boeing 747. Video system did not work for more than 1 hour, then work for a few hours and stopped working. No WIFI, very old plane. Service OK. Not good for business traveling."
820,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Doha. Similar to our outbound flight, the seats are comfortable but behind the competition, very small storage area , if you are tall try sleeping sitting up or in the cradle position as the bed is just not long enough. The food portions seems like you are forced to go on a diet, though the taste was ok. The entertainment system had the worst selection of any airline I have flown lately - but their check in baggage policy makes them a very attractive option when you see what their opposition charges for excess luggage."
821,"✅ Trip Verified |  London Heathrow to Houston. Despite sitting at the back of the plane we were really well looked after. Without exception all of the staff in this cabin were exceptionally friendly and professional. They really seemed to be enjoying their work. Lunch and a pre landing snack were provide together with an ice cream mid flight. Commendably, even in these days of austerity, my pre lunch gin was served with Fever Tree tonic. Well done BA. Frequent drinks runs were made. Despite its age the Jumbo was well turned out internally. The only downside was because of Air Traffic issues at Heathrow the flight arrived late. This meant that we almost missed our connecting domestic flight. This was mainly down to tardy Immigration procedures, the need to pick up our bags and transfer to another terminal for our ongoing flight. All very stressful."
822,Not Verified |  Larnaca to London. This A320 is totally unsuitable for a flight of this length. The seat pitch and width are the same for economy and club. Having paid €1000 for my flight it's disgraceful on flight where you are sitting for more than 5 hours in an expensive Club Europe seat the personal space is so tight. If the person in front reclined their seat it's a nightmare. The seat in the middle is blocked but getting out if the seats in front are reclined is hazardous.  You pay for a Club ticket for space and comfort and get nothing. 
823,"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked my BA flight from Zurich to London Heathrow using Avios, my frequent flyer number had to be added 3 times during the booking process. When I tried to reserve an aisle seat (for medical reasons) the BA website showed that all of the seats had been allocated save for a few seats for which I would have had to pay about thirty pounds. The check-in area for BA at Zurich airport is in a hard to find spot of the airport. The check-in agent was very professional, helpful and informative. The area of departure from Zurich was by transfer train. The flight boarded in an orderly manner and left more or less on time. I was dismayed to see cabin crew serve alcohol to a group of already drunk German speaking sports fans. One of the cabin crew declared that she had run out of beer and then suggested to an increasingly loud and aggressive man that he might like the cider instead. In the meantime the same crew members ignored me and other passengers while offering the trolley service. The overhead maps were not used and the captain made minimal announcements during the flight none of which were in German. The flight arrived reasonably promptly."
824,✅ Trip Verified |  The booking process was easy enough but they have reduced the baggage allowance in terms of the seats one can book. The cost of including a bag added considerably to the cheapest fare. Check-in was well managed and it was good to see passengers with too much luggage required to check their bags in. Departure was well managed and although there was a delay the captain communicated well. My gripe is that my seat was dirty and the window was also dirty.  Some of the to buy M&S food items were not available and the lavatory I used was dirty. The staff were very professional and pleasant and the drop-down route map was nice especially for the younger passengers to enjoy. Hardworking crew.
825,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Tokyo Narita. Had a fantastic flight in the new BA First cabin on the Boeing 787. On both journeys the crew were outstanding as was the food and the service. The food was of high end restaurant standard, the seat comfortable."
826,"✅ Trip Verified |  Bridgetown to London Gatwick. Paid for a Business Class flight. The onboard service was abysmal. No refreshments offered on boarding. Dinner took three hours to be served (on a night flight). My Husband had to go to the Galley twice for his dinner requests, he’d been forgotten. I requested ‘Express’ service, which didn’t happen. Website advertises ‘Premium Levels of Service’ and ‘Every Journey Unique and Unforgettable.’ The service was dreadful, but the journey was definitely unforgettable for the wrong reasons. Don’t waste your money with this airline, you don’t get what you pay for and they try to compensate by offering loyalty points, and telling you that you don’t pay for the Service, that the extra costs are for taxes, the Lounge and extra loyalty points. All BA could respond with was a goodwill gesture of loyalty points. Really?"
827,"✅ Trip Verified |  St Lucia to Gatwick on which my wife and I were both involuntarily downgraded from Premium Economy to Economy due overbooking on the flight. It should be noted that at no time was there any announcement for volunteers for downgrading at Vieux Fort Airport. I now know from your cabin crew that it is normal practice for appeals for volunteers to be put over the tannoy system before any enforced downgrades. At the time of going through the baggage hall getting our boarding passes we queried them as none had seat numbers on them to which we were told to just to go through security and our seats would be allocated when we went through the departure gate. Once in the departure lounge all four of us were tannoyed to return to the baggage hall when we were then told that my wife and I were being downgraded to economy. The male telling us this more or less indicated this was the only way we would be getting on the flight giving us £75 per each on a prepayment card as compensation under Article 7.3 of EC 261/2004 stating however that this did not affect our statutory rights. He then told us he would find us in the departure lounge and then all four of us had to go through security once again. The male who we spoke to in the baggage hall did not come and find us, we had to go and find him when he also told me that he had put my wife and I on a row with no other passengers which we assumed, rightly or wrongly, was so we could not tell people sitting beside us about the poor service we had received from BA. However two other passengers did come and sit beside us with the passenger sitting beside my wife telling her this was because the seat they had been allocated was soaking wet and smelt of urine and the cabin crew had asked them to sit on it with a cushion which they had refused and so they were given the seats next to us which was no problem. What further concerned me even more was one of your cabin crew walking past another passenger with their seat in the reclined position on three separate occasions just prior to approaching Gatwick and after the Pilot had requested seat belts on and seats in upright positions, never telling the passenger to raise their seat. BA’s latest advert celebrates 100 years of BA but for me their service is going backwards. The music that accompanies the advert is called ‘Salvation’ and by the end of the flight my wife and I were surely seeking it. Article 10 of EC Regulation 261/2004 is worth reading if this happens to you."
828,"✅ Trip Verified |  Chicago to London. Cancelled flights just a few hours before I left home, then put me on a different flight which would have made it impossible to make my connecting flight. Was finally put on a different flight. On the way home, because my first flight was through American Airlines, and the second through British Airways (all in the same booking), I was only able to check in and get a seat on the American Airlines flight, as I was redirected every time to their website. Couldn’t check in for the British Airways flight so had to have a middle seat which is very uncomfortable. I always check in 24 hours before to guarantee a seat, but BA wouldn’t allow me to do this."
829,✅ Trip Verified |  London to Bangalore. This was the worst experience. I flew with my infant daughter ande cabin crew was extremely rude. I was surprised that there was no way to heat milk for my daughter. I found the food portions so meagre. Not sufficient for a child also.  British Airways is sad in every sense of the term.
830,"✅ Trip Verified |  Hamburg to Abu Dhabi via Heathrow. The 1.5h flight from Hamburg to Heathrow was like flying a budget carrier. No free service at all, everything has to be purchased at inflated prices. Heathrow T5 the usual chaos. I can use the F Lounge due to my One World status. Massive lounge, crowded with the charm and food quality of a Cafeteria. Toilets filthy. One of the worst lounges I’ve seen. Boarding orderly and well organized. Boeing 788 IFE screen broken. Seats very uncomfortable and narrow. Service and food quality average. Flight Abu Dhabi to Heathrow delayed by almost an hour due to late arrival of the flight crew, this is something I have never experieinced before. Rest of the journey uneventful. Overall a rather disappointing experience. BA cannot compete with the Middle Eastern carriers."
831,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Seville. Following on from mistakenly booking a return flight with BA despite having a previous confirmed booking with a competitor, I quickly called up BA to resolve the issue. They understood the problem and gave me a full refund. The agent was exceptionally helpful on the phone and provided me a quick answer and solution to the problem. I don’t believe most airlines would have accepted my reasoning, however it’s great to see BA treat their customers with care."
832,"✅ Trip Verified |  Doha to Paris via London. This is the first time using BA since October 2002, nothing has changed,  the same reversible business class seats with very little storage space still comfortable but the business has caught up with BA and left them behind, with very poor entertainment selection and limited food choice. It cannot compare with other business leaders like Cathay and Qatar Airways but on this route BA charges the same price as Qatar Airways but delivers a much poorer product, though the service was OK not as personal but alright. Where they are better is with their check in luggage policy of 2 bags 32 kgs each they are superior and generous. I will still use them but look forward to them rolling in the new business class."
833,"✅ Trip Verified |  Madrid to London BA0457 on the 18/03. Couldn't have been a better service. Long time since I flew Club Europe but it was an amazing experience. The welcome aboard was excellent and so was the service and food. Stephen, one of the flight attendants was so attentive and happy to help that he probably made it the best short haul flight experience I have had in a long time. Well done to the crew on that flight!"
834,"✅ Trip Verified | On the flight to Tokyo, I was separated from my wife even though it was our honeymoon. Thanks. The return felt like a 12 hour easyJet flight. One meal and one half meal. Limited drinks. Very small seats. I’m 5 foot 9 and my knees touched the seat in front. Very, very mediocre."
835,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Vancouver. Check in agent very helpful in searching out seat options. Very smooth process. The disappointment was the receptionist at the Galleries Lounge at T3 who was rude and unhelpful. All was redeemed once on board. The crew were excellent throughout the flight in the best British Airways tradition - friendly, helpful and attentive. Food not great but on a par with economy in other airlines. Wines better than many airlines. The aircraft was clean and reasonably well maintained for an older 747-400. IFE selection good."
836,"✅ Trip Verified | The First Class zone at Heathrow T5 and the Concorde Lounge are very good. Service on board was excellent in both directions. The cabin layout is unimpressive and the food is nothing to write home about. The screen is small, with poor resolution. I enjoyed the flights in both directions, mainly because of the service. This First does not compare well with that of Middle Eastern and Asian airlines, but BA business class is so poor, I either fly economy or (when I am very lucky) try to fly First."
837,✅ Trip Verified |  I had a miserable experience in first class from London to Chicago. I had requested a special meal but that was not available. When I complained to customer relations they simply said too bad and insulted me by offering 10 K miles. The bathroom lacked amenities and i found the service was barebones. The angled suite is not private and when i stretched my feet hit a metal band in the middle of the foot rest. Video screen is small and must be stowed away 20 min before landing. Cabin crew never asked what I wanted and were only available when you press the call button. In flight entertainment is poor. 
838,✅ Trip Verified |  Leeds Bradford to Las Vegas via Heathrow. Customer services handling of my question never answered it. Three times I asked them to explain why the cost of my one checked bag caused the fare to increase over £100 on the outbound flight. This was before any increase other than the increase announced for the short LBA LHR fare. I asked why the fare was so much when I could have booked a seat for the bag for about £50. The response was we are doing what everyone else is doing. They never could explain why the fare increased by over £100 when I indicated one checked bag. I asked to speak with someone but that was never responded to. Book LHR LAS at that time and one bag included. Customer service apparently did not understand what I was asking because the answer provided was non-responsive. 
839,"✅ Trip Verified |  Dallas to London Heathrow in First Class. This is the worst experience I have had on a flight. The crew was indifferent and unresponsive, and treated you more like you were a nuisance to them. There was even less service from this so called first class crew than you get in tourist class in most airlines. The attitude and service of the crew was abysmal. When you have average food and wine on offer and a rather outdated cabin in first class, at least you should prioritize service as your competitive advantage to your full paying customers. This was nothing but a waste of money. I doubt very much I will go back to British Airways again."
840,"✅ Trip Verified |  Tenerife to Heathrow. Effectively a budget airline masquerading at premium airline prices. Have flown several budget airlines in the past which have offered far more in terms of value for money and service. Seats are rigid and I felt as if I was leaning forward for the the majority of the flight. When I tried to put my seat back to recline, I estimate it moved around 5 degrees. Leg room is also non existent. M&S food ran out halfway through the 5 hour flight and although cabin crew were apologetic, for food to run out during a lunchtime flight is inexcusable and highlights how badly the airline is being managed by the upper echelons. Furthermore, several other budget airlines at the airport had flights leaving directly from the terminal requiring no bussing of passengers. BA again in a move to save money opt for bussing passengers to the far reaches of the airport to avoid paying extra charges for utilising direct access from airport terminals. Can't fault the staff onboard who are clearly dedicated to the BA brand. They are professional, friendly and courteous. It's clear that British Airways are not the airline they once were and I hope that passengers begin to vote with their feet as drastic changes are needed to bring the airline back to its former glory."
841,"✅ Trip Verified | Heathrow to Larnaca - departed on time, flight nearly full. M&S food available to passengers ran out while cabin crew were half way down the aisle. Larnaca to Heathrow - two messages received while in Larnaca airport - the flight would be delayed by over an hour-departure was supposed to be at 7.15 pm but we took off nearer to 9 pm. The second message was that there was no food to be served on the flight, ""we recognise that this does not meet with the standards you expect from us"". The flight was 5 hours long-so this combination of a delayed departure and no food available on board is totally unacceptable - worse than a budget airline. A midnight arrival at Heathrow was then compounded by off loading cargo before the passengers because of a ""balance problem"". In addition I was incorrectly charged Eur 75 on the return leg for my case - it was clearly the same case that I travlled out to Cyprus with but the system identified it as extra baggage. Cattle class is an under rated description of the service offered to customers. The only saving grace was the cabin crew-particularly the Customer Service Manager-who promised to follow up the baggage issue and logged my complaint. It will take ages to resolve but he was helpful and pleasant throughout. How British Airways can offer such a poor product and expect people to keep flying with them is beyond me."
842,"✅ Trip Verified |  Los Angeles to London. A very enjoyable and comfortable flight on the new recliner seat set up on the 787. BA have raised their game and provides a superior seat to make for a relaxed flight . If you are travelling solo a retractable divider gives you privacy from your neighbour. Only problem is the 2x3x2 layout is one too many seats across, as it leaves two very narrow gangways; if you have an aisle seat in the ""turn right"" section in Business Class you will be constantly whacked unintentionally(?) by Economy section passengers with their carry-ons when boarding. Food and drinks were excellent, with courses served separately and the wine bottle frequently produced by flight attendants who gave a great service to their passengers. Entertainment choice also excellent with a film choice for everyone. Thanks also to two people most of us forget - the flight crew who got us safely to Heathrow 15 minutes early and put the plane down so gently we hardly noticed we had arrived! Well done BA for providing such a good product and service."
843,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Phoenix, BA289 yesterday. The plane was supposed to land at 1835. However, it landed at 1940. Because of this I missed my connecting flight to Ontario, California aboard American Airlines. By the time I was able to go through custom and pick up my luggage, it was already 2030. The flight departs at 2037. I went to the ground crew of American Airlines, they told me that I will not be able to make it to my connecting flight as they are already on the runway. They then directed me to British Airways. I went to the ground attendant of British Airways and she told me to go back to American Airlines to get it re booked. I went back to American Airlines then they told me again to back to British Airways since they are they the one who caused the delay. I went back to British Airways with the American Airlines supervisor. The British Airways attendant gave me a card with the customer service number and told me to call them in the morning. She did not offer any explanations or anything. American Airlines said we can re booked it for tomorrow morning but they did not offer any accommodation. I ended up getting my own car rental and drove from Phoenix to California in the middle of the night since I was not able to resolve this issues with both airlines."
844,"✅ Trip Verified |  San Francisco to London. After paying £4000 for flights which I had to cancel, they wouldn't allow any change of dates or change of name, and after all that wouldn't give me the  Avios points because I wont be on the flight."
845,"✅ Trip Verified |  Rome to London. One of the best European airlines to travel with for short haul flights. The online website is very clear and easy to use. Check-in procedure was smooth. The gate was very close to the shopping area. Boarding the flight was very well organised and quick and through the airbridge. The only negative aspect is that you will need to pay for a drink, as they don’t serve anything free on all European routes."
846,"✅ Trip Verified |  Cologne to Gatwick in economy class with an silver status BA card. No online check-in available.  BA website suggests passenger to arrive at the airport 3 hours before flight departure but airport check-in (the only available option) starts 2 hours before departure. No lounge available (there is a lounge in the terminal open to other airline customers, except BA). No priority boarding for Business and elite level passengers. Boarding the plane by bus. Not even free water on board in economy."
847,"✅ Trip Verified |  Tampa to Gatwick. I paid to have my seats bumped up to business class and when I got to the airport they wouldn't let me on the flight because someone on their side messed up when they booked my seats, so instead of honoring my seats they just sat there for an hour telling me they can't do anything and I can't get on the plane. They waited till the very last second before the check in period closed to reissue my tickets and won't reimburse me for the seats that I paid for, but never received. "
848,"✅ Trip Verified | London Heathrow to Madrid. I travel from LHR regularly. British Airways have proved to be reliable and their service is of good quality. As a frequent traveler, I've been able to use the priority boarding and also managed to get exit row seats. This airline is very good with providing tangible benefits to silver members. The lounge at Heathrow Terminal 5 is also very good and provides a good selection of food and refreshments. The bar is very well stocked and also a good selection of soft drinks available. I'm very happy with the airline service and would definitely recommend British Airways. Keep it up guys."
849,"✅ Trip Verified |  Gatwick to St Lucia return. Recently returned from a two week holiday with my wife in Caribbean for a 60th birthday celebration. Tickets bought in August 2018 and decided to spoil ourselves with a Club Class return, having flown out Premium Economy. Arrived at airport to be told that we'd been downgraded to Premium Economy due to overbooking. Apologetic ground staff (defending the indefensible) but no apology on the plane. Fuming all the way back to London, exacerbated by hopeless cabin staff service (tea when I asked for coffee) and filthy food. Complained on return through BA exec Club webiste with response from Customer Service 10 days later. BA claims that overbooking is a very rare occurrence and gave a lukewarm apology. Evidence from ground staff on both journeys contradicts this and it seems to be a standard occurrence during peak season. We booked early so probably had relatively cheap seats. BA has presumably made money by selling our tickets to a higher bidder. General quality of BA service, food and wine has fallen dramatically over the last few years. BA is now effectively a low cost airline, flying a fleet of very tired aircraft, trying to preserve the gloss of a quality airline. The accountants may win in the short term but passengers will vote with their feet. Avoid this airline if you possible can. And the final insult in booking premium seats with BA is that you get charge £40 to pre reserve in Club and £70 in Premium Economy. BA, you are having a laugh with the flying public. On this performance you don't deserve to stay in business."
850,"✅ Trip Verified |  It's been many years since I flew long haul British Airways and I was pleasantly surprised by recent flights. BA staff used to be offhand and inhospitable but that's all changed. From the time of arriving at London Heathrow T5 the staff have been really friendly and helpful. Similarly on the flight, the attendants couldn't do enough for me. When I requested tomato juice with Worcester sauce, the attendant made a special trip to the rear to get it. On the way back I asked for a tonic water and, again, they offered to go and get it. The seating of these newer planes allows me knee room, even though I'm 6ft 3ins and the headrest can be slid up high enough too. The entertainment system, though a little quirky in its operation and menu system compared to the slickness of Cathay Pacific, nevertheless had a good range of movies and TV to watch. Both flights ended up arriving on time, despite delays at Heathrow both ways, and the pilots kept us cheerfully informed as what was going on. Food quality was reasonable, again not up to the standard of Cathay Pacific, rather let down by a filled croissant for breakfast which I thought was a bit mean. Overall a very pleasant flight, thanks BA. Is this because competition is hotting up and BA now have to try harder?"

London Heathrow / Pisa return. My wife and I fly this route 3-4 times a year as we have a home in Tuscany. Sometimes we pay in long advance to get a decent price, or we pay using Avios. This return trip was the latter. It is what it is. The most miserable rip off for a business class seat in the world. I have seen last minute flights on this route as high as £700 return. BA should be ashamed of themselves. The only reason we fly this product is that you get the business class lounges in both directions. The seating is at the front of the plane for a speedy exit. The new meals are quite good and the free (is it really free?) booze. The seats are the biggest con. Three seats for two - with a dumb table in the middle. Unless you are in the front row the leg room is a disaster. On the way out we had a nice tomato and mozzarella salad + wine. On the way back - a ploughman's lunch, it was okay-ish. As a 60 year old businessman, one who has worked globally in my career in the US, Japan and the Middle East - and having sold my business a few years ago, to one of the largest PLCs in the country - I think I know a bit about running companies. I know I could do a lot better than the current board at BA. Last week when I was away, I read that BA have posted well in excess of one billion profits last year. Oh, what a surprise and that's the clear objective of the directors. So what would I do with Club Europe? I'd make it the best in Europe. The seat would be larger, like an arm chair. A 2+2 configuration. There would be a nice centre table. Charge ports for phones/laptops. Headsets. TV screens mainly for news - but some movies for flights over 2 hours. Extra 6"" of leg room behind row ""1"". Nice cutlery and glass/china ware. Hot meals. And i'd probably sell it at £25 a flight more. ""Build value guys"" and the profits will follow. Its the oldest dictum in the book. I will give credit where credit is due. On the way back, on the ground, the Captain announced there was possible a technical problem with the starboard aileron. As an aviation buff I loseley understood the problem and figured it was not really a big deal. Clearly some passengers were worried we were on a duff plane. He picked up on that and took the initiative to take a relaxed walk, the length of plane, asking if anyone had concerns or questions. One or two did and he answered their concerns in a calm and thoughtful way and explained he was only taking a precautionary measure. Very nice chap. We took off 2 hours later when it was fixed and everything was fine. FAs in both directions were very good."
852,✅ Trip Verified | Edinburgh to Boston via London. The planes are ancient and need to be replaced. If these were cars they would have an antique plate. The seats are uncomfortable and worn. There is no lumbar support. The space between the seatback in front and your face is inches. It’s really claustrophobic. The food is awful and last evening we were not offered a choice. So for $1200 each we had horrible seats and terrible food. The short connecting flights do not even offer bottled water. The M&S menu is expensive and offers limited choices. Meal deals in the airport convenience and drug stores offer much better options for less than half the price. The planes on both long legs of the trip last week were filthy. The cabin crew on the BOS to LHR and LHR to EDI were good. There was one member in the LHR to BOS who was snippy to passengers and seemed put out by needing to do her job. Boarding is supposed to be by group but was a disaster as people queued up well before their section was called and it made it extremely difficult to get to board. British Airways has become like a budget airline who does not charge budget pricing.
853,"✅ Trip Verified |  Gatwick to Mauritius. My wife and 2 friends booked and paid £56 each to select our seats with additional legroom adjacent to the bassinet stowage. On boarding the flight the configuration of the aircraft differed, meaning we had the same seat row and number but without the additional legroom. My formal complaint to BA has been met with what can only be described as condescending platitudes and a blank refusal to refund our seat booking fee. We feel that this a scam and are continuing to pursue the matter. Trading standards are also being informed. It didn’t help the aircraft was delayed by 4 hours on the outward leg, was filthy dirty. The return flight had numerous IFE defects and my seat recline did not work. I also noted a number of cabin minor airworthiness issues, (I am a licensed engineer). A marketing email in celebration of 100 years of service has thanked me for flying hundreds of thousands of miles with BA and then rips me off with nothing in return. British Airways you are a disgrace, get your act together and provide the service you were once famed for."
854,"Not Verified |  Flew out of Heathrow on 22nd Feb to New York, 20 mins into our flight and we noticed our Tv's weren't working (4 travellers) but I have to say the cabin crew managed to reset them and they we were working within the hour. The reason for reviewing this is how wonderful the crew were. The crew on this flight were amazing, nothing was too much trouble. Thank you to all involved on that flight."
855,"✅ Trip Verified |  Horrible flight BA from Gatwick to Cape Town and Iberia on the return. I am only 5'2"" 8st 10 and I find the leg room too cramp. The onboard flight entertainment system was down on the BA flight most of the time. It was probably in the last 2 hours of the flight before they managed to fix it and the system was old fashioned and movies were streamed on a loop. The food was barely edible. Coming back on Iberia the entertainment system was better and the food was also better but the seats legroom was just as bad. I was almost bumped off my connecting flight at MAD due to the lockers being filled up. I had another connection to make at LHR and I was not going to miss that so I had to insist they let me on though loads of other passengers were led off. This was the worst flight I have flown on. Last long haul BA flight for me."
856,"✅ Trip Verified |  New York to Venice via London. Staff have been nice when around but aircraft, food, assistance and information all deplorable. Booked Business class. First flight, overnight from JFK to Heathrow - quick, mediocre food service then gone. Chair is set up so I’m staring at a stranger, it’s uncomfortable and difficult to maneuver with no instructions. Didn’t wake me for breakfast, not sure why they had me fill in a form for when I wanted to be woken up. No instructions for the transition between BA flights. Now I’m on the flight from Heathrow to Venice, no offer of coffee, water but worse, business class is just coach class, no extra leg room, just 3 seats with the middle one blocked out. Person in front of me put their seat back and my knees are in my chest. I didn’t pay for international business class to get stuck in uncomfortable seats for 2 long flights. I won’t fly BA again. "
857,"✅ Trip Verified |  Chicago to London Heathrow. Club Class on British Airways is without doubt the worst in the airline industry.  It is bad enough that BA persist using out of date airplanes, circa 25 year old B747-400's, but they perpetuate the dreadful ying/yang seating arrangement of Club Class, where you have to look directly at the passenger next to you, and raise a screen for privacy. Then, mid-flight the crew lower the screen to serve the food. To leave the seat, one has to climb over the legs of a sleeping passenger;~no mean feat in the dark. The crew from Chicago were appalling, and dumped the food upon us as quickly as possible. Breakfast was inedible, and I returned it uneaten. The lounge at O'Hare was a crowded, tiny, dirty facility, with a food bar including some wilted vegetables and crackers with cheese. Insufficient chairs, and a single, old TV. Does no one at BA care how BAD they have become for premium class passengers."
858,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Chicago. Could it get any worse? The flight to Chicago was equipped with the usual ancient Boeing 747-400. The British Airways First Class product doesn't come up to modern Business Class standards. This particular flight was late again, and the food / wine was simply awful. There is nothing remotely elegant about BA First Class, and the crew demonstrate no sophistication. This experience was like dining at your worst restaurant chain. Finally, not only is the aircraft tired and worn out, but the in flight so-called entertainment system did not work, and had to be rebooted twice. The First Class seat is a bad joke, and extraordinarily uncomfortable. British Airways are at least twenty years out of date with their entire First Class product. All that can be said about this airline is woeful. The Concorde First Class lounge at Heathrow is filthy dirty, and desperately needs refurbishment."
859,"✅ Trip Verified |  Prague to London Heathrow. Very disappointing service. Cabin crew only managed to offer drinks to half the cabin, on a two hour flight that was already delayed - payment machine was broken, staff ran backwards and forwards as nothing seemed available on the trolley. On the bright said, I did save by not having to pay the over inflated prices."
860,"✅ Trip Verified |  London City to Florence. My flight was at around 7am in the morning. Not only it got canceled 3 hours before but at the moment there was no phone line open to call and manage a rebooking. On their site I had the option to reschedule my flight but I couldn’t select any flights on the same day. Interestingly i was able to find & book another one through Skyscanner again with BA at the day of my initial flight with £100 more, of course. Why couldn’t they simple show me this flight on the reschedule page? "
861,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Johannesburg. Since the aircraft was half full, I was looking for a great flight. We left on time, and that was the only positive point. I started watching a movie, and a young flight attendant  approached and asked for my dinner choice. I told her that I would love a G&T to start with, and then I will read the menu. She told me that this was a late evening departure (9pm is not late for me) and that no pre-dinner drinks would be served. I insisted (this is business class after all, half full flight). 30 minutes later, she brought a tray with everything on it (G&T, first dish, main dish, and dessert).  Never was I offered wine or coffee. The lights were turned off, and I did not see a flight attendant until 1:30 hours before landing.  Other passengers in business where treated the same and complained."
862,"✅ Trip Verified |  Doha to London Heathrow. Flight on time, not completely full, had an aisle seat near back of plane without the entertainment box in the way. Some reviews say that the last few windows are blanked off at rear of the aircraft but not so on this plane. Breakfast was served which was OK. Cabin crew mixed, mostly young and worked quickly. Crew uniform still looks a bit tatty compared with rivals in this part of the world. There is good and bad still with BA - bad was the so called chicken wrap served just before arrival - leathery and inedible - why do they let themselves down with such a poor offering - hardly any passengers near me could eat it. Bad was that there was an old tissue and food wrapper in my seat pocket. Good was the newer aircraft and the breakfast has improved. Arrived on time at Heathrow but to a remote stand."
863,"✅ Trip Verified |  Miami to Tel Aviv via London. At Miami airport on October 2018 what a pleasure was dealing with the agent, so professional, nice and helpful to the every last detail. Now on February 2019 calling British Airways to redeem my Avios what another pleasure dealing with a patient, knowledgeable and nice agent. She explained everything in such detail. You are doing great with such fantastic employees. "
864,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Seoul. I normally fly business but this was a last minute flight and the cost of Club was prohibitive and so I thought I would give World Traveller Plus a go. The cabin is stylish and intimate and I was surprised how roomy and comfortable the seats were. The entertainment system was working well (although the adverts before every single showing are very annoying). I was happy with the headphones and small amenity kit and felt the staff were very welcoming. My only complaint was the slightly pointless menu we were given as for lunch neither of the meals listed were actually available. A similar thing happened with breakfast, three options, the third being the most appetizing, and no, it hadn't been loaded, so this is an area BA might want to look into. All in all the service was good and worth the price. For ground service BA, please at least keep a couple of desks for people to check into before automation puts us all out of work."
865,"✅ Trip Verified |  London Heathrow to New York JFK. Bag drop did not go well. Lounge (galleries north ) was good and not crowded. Boarding was fine, small delay, well organised. Pre take off drink was better than the one i got in club world 2 weeks previous. Main meal good, pre flight snack was average but my son really liked it. On time arrival, a good flight. Cabin crew included some of the older staff who are not mixed fleet crew and it stands out a mile. I thought this was a good flight."
866,"✅ Trip Verified | San Diego to London. From the moment that I boarded this flight (due to take off at 19.25), the crew had one interest and one only - to get the cabin lights off, which they duly achieved two hours later. As a consequence, the service was negligent in the extreme. This was a Club World ticket - so expensive and I looked forward to a decent level of service. However, I wasn't offered champagne on boarding, wine with my meal or coffee and port after my meal. I complained to BA when I got home but they weren't interested and I was met with a barrage of corporate platitudes. This flight was a disappointing end to what had been a great trip to the US & Mexico and has left me with a very poor view of the airline."
867,"✅ Trip Verified |  Gatwick to St Lucia. Flew BA new revamped business class today and a huge improvement on the old set up. Well lit cabin, improved seating comfort, better and operational entertainment system (always hit or miss before) and decent food. Cabin crew worked hard and were pleasant. I have observed along with everyone else the falling standards at BA and have moved most of my travel to rival airlines but on the basis of today’s experience I will consider them in the future. Much improved, well done."
868,✅ Trip Verified |  London to Chennai. It was amazing. The crew were very friendly. The food was amazing and the seats were comfortable. T was overall an amazing flight and I enjoyed it thoroughly.
869,"Not Verified |  London to Tampa. BA broke my suitcase and I did not make a fuss, I just got a new one. The new one was too large for the overhead bin on the return flight (the only suitcase I could purchase while abroad). So on top of the new suitcase, I had to actually pay BA to check the new bag. Cost me over $100 for their mistake. They also shovel off customer service to some company abroad. You will get an email a month later saying ""I'd like to know you that we are unable to offer refund"". Make a big fuss at the airport if they break your stuff so that you can avoid this black hole they call customer service.
"
870,"✅ Trip Verified |  My husband and I flew on British Airways flight BA-228 from Baltimore to London Heathrow leaving on the 12th February 2019. Every aspect of the flight was poorer than what budget airlines have to offer. The plane was shabby and dated. The seat reclining facility did not operate properly, was not that comfortable, and we had less legroom than the equivalent with budget airlines. The touch screen TV monitor was not working properly. One ear bud on the headphones did not work. The audio socket was too loose for the headphones so the plug kept falling out making it difficult to enjoy the in-flight entertainment (which in itself had a dated choice). The pillow was disgusting and kept falling out of the flimsy cover. The air conditioning lacked consistency alternating between very hot and very cold air. The restroom occupied sign always lit up as vacant even if it was occupied. However what made the flight very unpleasant was the bad attitude of the cabin crew. They were abrupt, unfriendly and quite clearly did not want to be there. There was one exception, an extremely pleasant older crew member who greeted us on and off the flight. There did not appear to be any organisation or smooth co-ordination when distributing the meals. Our two trays of food where placed on top of each other and practically thrown at us by a sour faced crew member. This flight was one hour late making us nervous about catching our connecting flight. There was no information or instructions given to us about connecting flight gate numbers before we landed. Unlike all the other airlines that I have travelled with there were no staff member greeting the connecting customers to point them in the right direction or re-assure them. British Airways would be my last choice of an airline to travel with and I would only fly with them again if there was no other option."
871,"✅ Trip Verified |  Bridgetown to Gatwick. I couldn't imagine that first class on BA would be the same as travelling in business class with for example Qatar, Emirates, Etihad, Singapore, Thai etc for double the price. Cabin, seats and food equals business class. One of the red wines on the wine list was out from start when I left London outbound. Cabin crew worked well and gave splendid service. But first class on BA is not worth the fare. When I complained to customer service after I got home, all I got was they are in the process of upgrading world traveller. "
872,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Athens. Classic BA love and hate relationship where one flight is perfect and another one is a total disaster. Problems in December 2018 at Heathrow check-in when BA check-in and baggage management IT systems went down for at least 90 minutes. Total chaos with people like myself arrived at the airport 2:30 hours before the flight and queuing while others arriving 45 minutes prior to their departure and given priority. Even though we were checked in at some point, the flight was delayed by 2+ hours on top of the problems. Then flight does not have enough food onboard. At least the crew clearly attempted to reduce flight time to the minimum."
873,"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked a British Airways flight from Amsterdam to London Heathrow. In the beginning everything went normal and smooth. Check-in and boarding was easy and on time and once everyone boarded the problems started one after another. First an announcement was made by the pilot about a flight delay due to strong winds in Heathrow (fair enough). Afterwards the wind problem was resolved but a passenger decided to leave so they had to take out his luggage. After that we received a 3rd announcement stating there is a computer malfunction at Schiphol Airport and they are doing their best to resolve it. This caused us already about 45-60 mins delay but me and other passenger still remained calm and relaxed and then the hell started. We received permission to take off after 7 mins and then the pilot offered passengers who do not wish to travel to leave the plane. Of course there were many passengers who were travelling on business and I guess too delayed to make it on time for their meetings so they decided to leave. The crew warned them that this might cause terrible delay and problems for the other passengers but they still decided to leave. So a group of passengers left and we missed our opportunity to take off. Then the pilot announced that we can take off after 2,5 or 3 hours. The flight was full of overseas travellers. We spent 2 hours sitting in a plane which was not moving anywhere, people unboarded the plane 4 times in total and no food or water was offered to us. We had to line up next to the bathroom to purchase food and drinks and pay for it. The overall experience was terrible and it ruined the whole plan for my first day in London."
874,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flying premium economy on British Airways from New Orleans to London was an absolute pleasure. The nine hour flight was an amazing experience, with great legroom, reclining seat for a nice sleep and low noise. Definitely recommend and will be flying premium on long haul again."
875,"✅ Trip Verified |  Tokyo to London. I was looking forward to this flight because of the Club World ticket and because it was my first time flying on a Boeing 787. We had a good check-in experience, breezed through the airport and enjoyed the JAL Lounge at Narita. We boarded on time and first impressions of the Boeing 787 were good: a modern plane with nice mood lighting as we boarded. The food and wines were really good. I had a beautifully-presented Japanese starter followed by a bento-style lunch as a final reminder of the holiday and my wife chose the western options. There was plenty of choice on the IFE and there was a big screen. On the downside, the cabin was too hot which made it difficult to sleep on the flight. This was a problem that we encountered on our outbound journey too. The seat was comfortable and reclined fully but I find the layout of BA Club World a little awkward because you have to step over another passenger's footrest to access the aisle. The cabin crew were efficient but seemed a bit exhausted and could have been more friendly and welcoming. The context to this review is that we spoiled ourselves and flew in first class on the way to Tokyo. We had an amazing experience with such comfortable seats and exemplary service from the cabin crew. We both felt a bit disappointed with the return flight in comparison and felt there was room for improvement, but at the same time our expectations might have been too high because of the previous flight."
876,✅ Trip Verified |  London to Tokyo Haneda. My wife and I treated ourselves to first class flights for our holiday to Japan with the help of my Avios and a BA Amex companion voucher. We were very excited about flying first class and the dedicated check-in area at Heathrow was great. We boarded on time and the cabin did not disappoint. We had very grand seats with lovely surroundings. The cabin staff who looked after us were fantastic and really took the time to get to know us and understand what we wanted. The food and alcoholic drinks were great. I went for beef main course followed by the amazing chocolate and toffee pudding. I was ready to sleep after all that food but saw that there was lots of choice and a large screen for the IFE. My wife and I both said afterwards that it didn't feel like a long-haul flight because the time passed so quickly and comfortably. My only complaint is that the cabin was uncomfortably hot while we were cruising which made it harder to sleep.
877,"✅ Trip Verified |  I was flying London to Billund today via British Airways and I was a bit hesitant as I’ve never flown with this airline, due to early morning traffic I was running a little behind schedule and I had a 23kg bag to also check in and check in closed 45 mins before my flight departs. Upon arrival I was greeted my a young gentlemen who was very helpful and respectful. He calmed me down and reassured me that everything was going to be okay ,as I was very very stressed thinking I was going to miss my flight. He then offered to give me fast track through security so I could get to my gate quicker. I just want to thank him again as he made my experience with British Airways like no other and I’m very grateful."
878,"✅ Trip Verified |  San Diego to Frankfurt via London. It all started when trying to check in online 24h before departure from San Diego to Heathrow. On long flights like this I always reserve an aisle seat. Online Check-in did not work, no reason was given. Ok, let’s call US hotline. I tried at least 40 times. Answers were either, that call could not be completed, check number or due to heavy call volume they could not process call right now. I did not make it through. As an act of desperation I today called a British number. The lady told me guess what: no more aisle seats available. Some other numbers I tried were available on weekdays only, good to know if you need help on a Sunday. So I‘ve got the strong feeling, that they do not even care about there customers. B On my flight to San Diego 5 days ago, my TV screen was gone and there was no way to change seats. Great overall experience."
879,✅ Trip Verified | Flown with British Airways on numerous occasions with no issues. However on this occasion my baggage was lost on arrival at Gatwick. There was no British airways representative at the baggage claim however there was a phone that allowed me to call the baggage department. Reclaiming lost baggage was simple and my bag was put on the next flight to Singapore which I received the following day.
880,"✅ Trip Verified | Flying last Sunday from Geneva to Piladelphia via London in business class. When I arrived at the boarding gate in London to take my flight to Philadelphia they told me that there was no sufficient business seat available! They overbooked! My choice was then either to fly ecenomy or to take the next flight! They just did not care about their customer. No phone call, no email, no indication at the lounge nothing until I was at the boarding gate. I kindly accepted to take the next flight. The plane was delayed by 1 hour due to technical issues. When I arrived at Philadelphia, no suitcase! No British Airways desk on arrival, it was late no one could help. I finally retrieve my suitcase 3 days later: broken! During these 3 days, it was impossible to get someone on the phone. On my flight back to Geneva, same issue! no sufficient business class seats available. It is clear that this company just don't care about their customers, they just care about their money !"
881,✅ Trip Verified |  London Heathrow to Paris CDG. Quick and easy flight to Paris. Took just 40 minutes to reach CDG. Everything went well and the cabin was very clean. The only complaint was boarding which too way too long and was very unorganized.
882,"✅ Trip Verified |  Johannesburg to London. At Johannesburg used BA galleries lounge which was fine if a little busy. Plane boarded on time, very hot due to lack of auxiliary power unit, given aircraft at JNB all day, perhaps this could have been addressed. After take off the crew dispensed with pre dinner drinks and went straight for meal. Portions of starter very small, I was given someone else’s by mistake which was then taken away and given to him. I thought that originally the idea of the new Club World meal involved a trolley service but no sign of that. Main was good (beef), dessert was cheese, very small basic selection. Then bed, gap in seat made lie flat less comfortable. Breakfast was ok. Delay with baggage due to another aircraft technical issue (there seemed to be a few of these). Arrivals lounge was good. Overall an average experience."
883,"✅ Trip Verified | Edinburgh to Bangalore via Heathrow. Rude staff, poor service, missing baggage, poor entertainment system. I spilled my drink and the attitude of the staff was brutal. I apologised for my clumsiness, but I was made to feel like I had deliberately done some shameful act in public and staff would not want to have anything to do with me. I asked for tissues and the answer was, get it from the toilet. The staff did not even have the courtesy to ask me if I needed another drink once I cleaned myself up. The crew were also extremely noisy. Chatting and laughing loudly at the pantry place for the entire duration. And then - while boarding at Edinburgh, they offered to check in my second bag for free because cabin was full. The staff wrote Bangalore via Heathrow, but my bag was not loaded to connecting flight. 4 hours gap mind you. "
884,"✅ Trip Verified |  
Berlin to Johannesburg via London. The short haul flight between Berlin and London was oKay, they don't include drinks or snacks anymore on short distance flights and prices onboard for them are compared to some low-cost carriers high. Because of an engine problem, the flights from LHR to JNB was delayed by 2:45h. British Airways gave £5 vouchers out to compensate for snacks and drinks. Inside the A380, the IFE boxes under the window seats take a big part of the available leg space."
885,✅ Trip Verified | New York JFK to London Heathrow with British Airways. An extremely average flight. Nothing stood out as good and nothing stood out as bad. The flight was smooth and felt quite short. The cabin crew was helpful and everything was comfortable. The inflight entertainment needed some work.
886,"Not Verified |  I've always favoured British Airways and will always try and choose to fly with them, which is mostly decided by flight times for my business travel. I have always found it better value over the cheaper airlines via their additonal benefits like early check-in and on-flight catering, for economy. However BA have stripped both the above perks. I now struggle to see the value, and put their offering almost beside that of the likes of Easyjet, yet you pay almost double. Then today I flew back from Denmark with SAS, and it was amazing and made BA look cheap. Not only do you get a good meal on board, you get free drink, can charge your electronics and get wifi (for only 2.9 Euros!). Outstanding."
887,"✅ Trip Verified | New York to London via Geneva with British Airways. The plane was late, not an issue. But some flight attendants were not really friendly in their manner, they seemed in a rush to finish the service and then chill loudly. On a 7 hour flight, they served us the food 40mins after departure, then 20mins at the most after started clearing, we were not even close to finish eating. Then 5 mins after another staff member just came by an took most of the food we didnt even had time to tell him not to. This was really poor service. Especially to realise that because the aircraft was only half booked, they were actually rushing us to be able to stop serving and take a nap comfortably on the raws of empty seats next to us. Thats what you call bad customer service! ps: i was charged 100$ for a luggage, after buying my ticket 350$"
888,"✅ Trip Verified | A380 boarding is always a nightmare, but it was complicated on this occasion by multiple pax in wheelchairs and a delayed show-up by the pilots. Fortunately, we still managed to take off more or less on time. The cabin crew responsible for our side of the First cabin was personable but lacked experience. The food served for dinner was a mixture of good and mediocre. Warm salmon on ice cold salad is never a pleasant experience. The seats in First are reasonably comfortable although they lack the privacy of competitors' premium cabin. The duvet was made redundant because of the typically overheated cabin. One of the First toilets was out of action so we had to make use of the Club World loos upstairs. It would have been helpful if cabin crew had apologised for the inconvenience for the lack of the convenience, but no comment was made. The IFE was passable and the sound quality good if one's own noise cancelling headphones are used. WiFi was available but I didn't make use of it. Breakfast was unremarkable and I wish bread rather than pastries was offered. Deplaning was delayed by half-an-hour because of early morning congestion at T5 and the lack of a stand. Overall, a reasonable flight but not first class."

The 2-3-2 seating in the front section of Club World on the upper deck feels marginally less cramped than 2-4-2, but it's showing its age in contrast to other carriers. A full cabin also means queues for the two loos, although they're a lot more spacious than in First. The drinks and dinner service took a good couple of hours, but the revamped Club World food is definitely an improvement. The fish option for the main course was some of the best food I've had in the air. The White Company bedding does little to cushion the rather hard seats. Cabin crew were generally good and the CSM was particularly visible during the flight. Breakfast was improved with the option to pre-select items. Arrival was ahead of schedule."
890,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Johannesburg. Smooth check in via Club World desks. Fast track security was fast and got to lounge quickly. Lounge was ok, food a little better and staff seemed more attentive. We were able to use the spa which was nice. Showers were fine with no queues. Flight left on time. My first experience of the new Club World catering which seemed to go well Slept for 5 hours, lie flat on the newer aircraft is better than the older 777’s which (as my son says) have a gap between stool and seat sometimes. Crew on this sector were good and the FA serving our area was experienced and it showed. The CSD seemed to go through the motions only. Arrival fine and baggage was first on belt. A good flight"
891,"✅ Trip Verified |  BA836 on 19 Jan. Excellent short flight from Heathrow to Dublin in Club Europe. Cabin Crew were warm and efficient and the overall service excellent. The Club Europe catering was excellent, I had pre-ordered a gluten-free meal which was the same as one of the standard passenger meals but with gluten-free bread. The main course was beef ratatouille with a Do&Co dessert pot. This was the best inflight meal I've had on a short haul flight. On arrival in Dublin the ground service from Swissport was poor, it took some time for steps to meet the aircraft and then even longer (25 minutes) for ground staff to open the door to allow arriving passengers into the terminal."
892,"✅ Trip Verified |  Whatever happened to the World's Favourite Airline? Returning from Bermuda to Gatwick we were presented with a worn-out Boeing 777. My seat table was broken with bits of seat plastic hanging off. I had to try and balance the seat tray on my knees so that the dinner tray could be kept flat, it didn't work, tray ended up on the floor with drinks and food. Reported this to steward who was clearly upset with my complaint and told me 'I'll put it in the book'. No apology, no attempt to explain, just irritation from him. The food was awful, neither my wife or I could finish it. It also seemed incomplete with no cheese and biscuits, and nothing to go on the salad. My wife's entertainment screen, didn't work, the passenger next to me screen didn't work and mine only worked intermittently. It look liked something from the Arc with the grid allowing the touch sensitivity clearly visible. I believe the 777s out of Gatwick are being updated, can't come a moment too soon. We purchased Premium Economy tickets for the this flight, we didn't get a premium service. Initially I was going to buy business tickets but the price was ridiculous so I'm glad I didn't. My frustration with BA grows every year, we only fly with them now when we have too."
893,✅ Trip Verified |  Kuala Lumpur to Miami via London in business class with British Airways. The business class seats were small for business class and pretty old. The flight entertainment system are outdated. I am not sure how they do the selection but they could do better with the crew selection. Food choices were limited and mine was not up to par for business class. Overall BA have to do better to be on top of their game. Planes has to be changed.
894,"✅ Trip Verified |  Zurich to Heathrow. Last year they started boarding flights by groups.  A week or two after the free beverages and snack service disappeared, and the final nail in the coffin was pay to choose seating. I decided no BA anymore. I moved away from BA, the only issue I have that now I have to maintain frequent flyer status with two or three separate airlines. The last flight I took BA to use my Avios points and I literally flew free, but never to use BA again."
895,✅ Trip Verified |  Miami to London. The breakfast served just before landing was terrible. A terrible croissant with some cream cheese with onions and a breakfast fruit bar. It was wrapped in cellophane. Hardly anyone ate it what a waste.
896,"✅ Trip Verified | Copenhagen to Amsterdam via London Heathrow with British Airways. There was problems at check in and a lot of people had to run to make the flight. But the attitude and welcoming hospitality of the crew made me forget that and I enjoyed the flight. The seats were nice and comfortable and the aircraft fresh. During the second flight from LHR to AMS, the expectations from the first flight were fulfilled and we had a captain that knew most of the passengers were frequent fliers and made jokes only frequent fliers would understand. Like how the taxi from Polderban is almost as long as the flight itself."
897,"✅ Trip Verified |  Antigua to Gatwick. Apparently it is necessary to pay extra to get a decent seat by priority booking despite having paid the full cost of world traveler plus. We checked in as soon as the online check in was available to find that only 4 seats (for the 4 of us) remained unbooked. We had to take 2 seats on the front row where the seats had no under seat storage and were as narrow as the economy seats, and 2 on the back row where we were constantly bothered by the adjacent toilets. Only 1 loo each side between the economy and economy plus meant that there were always queues of people leaning against us. Cabin pressure was uncomfortably low, overnight temperature was stifling hot and few people got any sleep at all. Breakfast was a hard cold half sandwich with a hurried cup of tea or coffee. Impossible to get any drinks or refreshments between the service rounds. Tatty seat covers, broken foot rest, malfunctioning entertainment, broken tables requiring us to hold our food and drink between our knees. When asked for help the stewardess told us she didn't have a screw driver to fix these things and it was an old plane with lots of this type of issue."
898,"✅ Trip Verified | I understand completely why there is air rage in the skies when companies such as BOAC go out of their way to make the travel experience an stressful and unpleasant as is humanly possible. I paid $813 to fly r/t LAX-BUH and yet they want an extra $150 to have a desirable seat. I understand if you check-in 24 hours before departure you receive a seat from those available, but why is it they assign you the worst seat available when betters are there? In my case, they assigned me a middle seat on a 787 when both of the adjacent aisle seats are available to assign. It is baffling. The ground crew and the inflight staff are excellent but can do little with the oppressive business decisions their executives make - everything comes down to make every penny they can. And why am I flying BOAC? They owed me £25 from the last flight b/c the inflight entertainment system was inop for 1/2 the cabin and so we all had to sit in the dark with nothing to do for a twelve-hour flight. On top of that, their seats have so little padding and cushion that only the plumpest can sit in their seats longer that 15"". For normal-sized adults, it is as agonising as the rack must've been. And of course you only get compensation by patronising them again. Now I know: ever a free ticket on BOAC is overpriced."
899,"✅ Trip Verified | London to Miami. Worst long haul business class. That annoying divider, the ridiculous fold down footstool and the worn out seats! The service is non-existent, unless they are serving you the meal. If you want a snack or drink get out your seat and hunt down a cabin member, they don’t ask you if you need anything between meals. The toilets are dirty and basic. I’m a Gold Member but giving it up to fly other more updated airlines. They’ve crammed as many business class seats as possible at the expense of comfort and it’s not like they’re cheap."
900,"✅ Trip Verified | I used avios point to upgrade from economy to premium economy. They get a wider seat and a few more inches leg room. Boarding was straight forward and the premium cabin had plenty of overhead locker space, water and juice was served before takeoff but no champagne. The staff were well turned out but rushed, as the premium cabin was served by the economy cabin crew. A hot meal was served an hour after take off, which was a good piece of beef with stewed vegetables, chocolate mousse and biscuits & cheese. Quality red and white wine was served. The inflight movie selection was OK. A light snack of biscuits and crisps was served before landing along with coffee & tea. Getting off the planes was slowed by immigration staff coming onto the plane to inspect all passports. Not my best flight."
901,"✅ Trip Verified | Boarding was fairly quick, the well turned out staff quickly got people on board and bags stored. I was lucky that no one was sitting next me, so I had some more room. The pre take off drink was water or orange juice.  Within an hour of take off a hot meal of beef - salad was served with a good dessert. Wine selection was very American with jug wines. The movie selection was OK. The PE seats are more comfortable than economy, the extra 4 inches of width make a huge difference. The 2nd meal on this flight was a snack of crisps and cookies. "
902,"✅ Trip Verified |  Bangalore to London. Ground experience not great - at LHR automated bag drop didn't work and it wasn't clear why; slow-to-react assistance eventually came and identified travel visa to India needed to be validated. At BLR, no online check-in available and slow process. Plane decor extremely run down and shabby, various pieces of the interior trim (bulkheads etc) rattling  and latches for bassinet shelves not locking. Row 12 so bulkhead seat and legroom excellent, however this comes with the hassle of not being able to leave anything on the floor for takeoff and landing; the stowage racks are never big enough to hold the blanket and pillow provided. Seat itself could have more width (I kept bumping the VOD control and I'm quite slim), recline limited and footrest could extend more. No USB power in seat which seems crazy in this day and age. VOD itself is atrocious; tiny screen (folding out of armrest on bulkhead seats), low resolution, visible gridlines and very little choice (hardly the latest movies). To top it off, on outbound leg the VOD stopped working altogether and resisted many resets. Customer service forms were handed out so I await the outcome of that. Food volume OK, quality poor (scrambled eggs in breakfast smelled terrible!), plenty of drinks on outbound leg but not inbound, cabin staff seemed indifferent on inbound leg. Insufficient lavatories for Premium Economy and Economy."
903,"✅ Trip Verified |  Barcelona to New York via London. I was in Barcelona for just four days so had one small bag which they asked me to check. My flight from Barcelona to London was delayed causing  passengers to miss their connections. When I finally got a flight, we taxied for an hour and then were told we needed to return to the gate as the luggage was loaded incorrectly. It took me nearly 24 hours to travel from Barcelona to JFK.  When I arrived, my luggage wasn't there so I filed a claim. I called and emailed every day and they couldn't find it even though I had a tag number and and documentation. Eight days later, they finally contacted me and gave me a six hour window for bag delivery. The final insult is that I was expected to file a claim for my missing personal property within seven days. As a result, they have offered me no compensation for damages. "
904,"✅ Trip Verified |  Gatwick to Fort Lauderdale. Charging to choose seats, even within 24h prior take off, is outrageous. So if someone decides to carry only hand luggage one cannot choose a seat without paying extra charges?"
905,"✅ Trip Verified |  We recently flew from London to Bologna, the aircraft was full and they requested that people place their cabin bags into the hold with checked in luggage to save space. So we did, when we arrived my carry on bag which has accompanied me on many flights over the past 3 years was damaged and beyond repair or use for our further journeys. So I approached the damaged/lost baggage area, lodged a claim and provided all the evidence, explained that we were continuing to travel and needed to replace the bag asap. I was advised by the representatives to ring BA service line. Made the call spoke about replacing the bag and what was reasonable and did that and submitted a claim. Well it is still going, despite replacing the bag with a cheaper version the total cost has not been refunded. They instead asked me to produce receipts from 3 years ago and then offered me half the money due to depreciation. Despite a good flight etc have this ongoing angst of the money they refused to refund."
906,"✅ Trip Verified |  
Venice to London City. Really we had a great experience with British Airways. We enjoyed very much flying with British Airways. Lovely staff and great service."
907,"✅ Trip Verified |  San Francisco to London. Terrible service and food. Cramped uncomfortable seats and terrible entertainment, in one of my flights it wasn’t working. The crew couldn’t care less, I will not fly with them again !!!"
908,"✅ Trip Verified |  Heathrow to Vancouver. The seats booked not given, took 3 months to respond to a complaint after submitting multiple messages to them for an update. A dirty plane, fantastic front line staff I would never fly BA again."
909,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Bucharest. First class ground staff but in the air it's quite a disappointment. The basic economy seats have so little cushion it is agony to sit for longer than 15"" in them. And £1.95 for a can of coca-cola? "
910,"✅ Trip Verified |  I forgot I had purchased a hand baggage only fare. At the airport I was charged more than 60 euros for my bag which came out as almost as much as the fare itself cost. The staff at check-in could not have been less helpful. The whole experience was of a bad low-cost airline. Boarding process saw me in Category 5 having to board last, not so much as a glass of water is offered. The seats have very little legroom and just one toilet for the A319 economy cabin. "
911,"✅ Trip Verified |  When the passenger in front reclines his/her seat, it makes it very difficult to get in and out of one's seat. As the arm rests do not go all the way up, the middle/window seat passengers have to climb over. There is little leg room and no leg rest. The Boeing 777 IFE screen is smaller than the ones on the British Airway's 747-400s and could do with an upgrade. The saving grace on this flight was the excellent service from a dedicated and very professional flight crew."
912,"✅ Trip Verified |  Boston to London. World Traveler seats. Nice headrest. Legroom okay but overall very cramped especially when the passenger in front reclines his/her seat. The seat back was almost in my lap making it impossible to read British Airways' magazine or even use my iPad. We ordered special meals (Halal and low sodium). The Muslim meal (chicken tikka masala with naan) was restaurant quality. Flavorful and not spicy hot. The gulab jamun dessert was also restaurant quality and just like mom's. The low sodium meal - herb roasted chicken, tomato rice, petite broccoli, diced red pepper and carrots was delicious. Dessert consisted of fresh blueberries and blackberries. The IFE was very good. Bright and clear LED screens with a good selection of entertainment and movies in several languages. "
913,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Athens. We were fortunate to get exit row seats in advance. They were spacious with plenty of legroom. They had more width than the cramped Boeing 747-400 that we had just flown in on. We each had a carry on; however, during the transit process, British Airways ground staff made us check one of our carry on bags.  I have no idea what criteria they used to select passengers to check their carry on bags. Bare bones service, no meals (which is okay), no complimentary soft drinks or water. Bottled water was available for purchase. In hindsight, we would have been better off flying on Aegean Airlines."
914,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Johannesburg. So impressed by the lady that checked us in. Something went wrong with my booking, I was supposed to fly at 18:10 (with my boyfriend) back home to South Africa after our visit in UK, but somehow my ticket was booked at 21:10. We didn’t even notice that until she had brought it up at the check-in. I was so shocked by the fact that I would be traveling all by myself (It’s my first trip overseas). She was so willing to help and she fixed it within a matter of 1 minute. We obviously thought that we would not be able to sit next to each other. With grateful hearts we were checking in our bags. When she gave us our boarding passes she mentioned that we have the best seats on the aircraft! How awesome is that! Thank you British Airways and their helpful staff."
915,"✅ Trip Verified |  Newark to Bangalore return via London on BA premium economy (World Traveler Plus). I paid about 40% more for premium economy (about $600 extra) so approximately $150 per leg. Was it worth it? I'd say broadly yes, though I wouldn't want to pay very much more than that and it would be harder to justify if only one leg of 6-7 hours was involved. Before Boarding: Premium economy does get a standard 2 checked bag allowance whereas economy is 1 bag though there are numerous exceptions where they allow 2 (and India to US/Canada is one of those exceptions though it isn't clear if it applies for travel originating at either end). So I am not sure if I got an extra bag or not but I did use the 2 bag allowance Boarding: You board in Zone 3 after First/Business & the oneworld elites. That is helpful as you do get dibs on the overhead storage - if it doesn't fit in premium economy you can always put it in front or behind before economy begins boarding. This means you also get off fairly quickly - which can help if you're in a hurry to get through security at Heathrow for a connecting flight or through immigration at your final destination. In Flight: There is a welcome drink for premium economy (champagne, juice, water depending on the departure time). There is also a hot towel service also. 787 cabin: The 787-9 has a nicely done premium economy cabin. 2-3-2 seating as opposed to 3-3-3 in economy. So a somewhat wider seat. Seat pitch is also decent. These are new style slimmer seats though possibly less cushioned than what you get on older seats - but seat was comfortable. The food tray comes out of the armrest and there is some seat back storage (though not much). There is a small drinks tray built into the front of the arm rest which you share with your neighbor. There is a recliner style footrest with support for the calf. You do get a noise canceling headset which is nice and a basic amenities kit with eyeshades, socks and toothpaste. The seat back screen is large and easy to use. There is no restroom in the cabin but one immediately behind in economy - so not a long walk 777 cabin: 777 has a 2-4-2 seating in premium economy (same as club world) as opposed to 3-3-3 in economy. The 777 version used on the LHR-BLR sector has a very small premium economy cabin - just 3 rows of seats. This gives it a sort of cosy feel. You do have to walk all the way through the economy section immediately behind you to get to the restroom. Economy looked pretty full on both the legs on the 777 but premium economy was not full - and I had the seat next to me vacant on both legs. That helped me stretch out for sure. The seat back screen on the old 777 is much smaller and the seats are older but possibly more cushioned than the slimmer 787 seats. Food: Nothing much here. I didn't think it was all that different from what a regular economy meal would have been. It was OK - nothing to write home about. All in all, for such a long journey, the premium economy product did offer some additional comfort along with the early boarding and baggage. Worth it on extra long haul like US to India. Bit harder to justify on shorter flights or fewer legs."
916,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Berlin scheduled for 21st December. On approach to the airport, I got a message saying that my flight was canceled. No explanation was given. As I arrived at the airport, staff acted very confused and said their rerouting center is closed for the evening due to issues, and if I wanted to travel in the next days ahead of Christmas I should book my own travel with another airline or train company (e.g. Eurostar). My costs would  be reimbursed. The airport staff also said no further help from British Airways is available on the day to due airport issues. I felt the only way out was to rebook myself with a different airline for a hefty +300 GBP fare for a short haul flight for the next day. As it was Christmas, prices were very high. After I arrived at my destination, a lengthy exchange of messages with British Airways started, and British Airways said in the end they do not compensate costs for rerouting with a different airline (opposite to what their airport staff said on the day of cancellation). "
917,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Mumbai. I have had my battles with the leadership at BA because they would not let me book my seat and pay with their Airmiles. Now they have finally relented and this will please many who earn Airmiles through their credit cards. This is just to illustrate that I boarded BA199 with a slightly negative mindset, a mindset which was changed quickly. Although I travelled Economy, the seat was comfortable, the service excellent, as was the food. If I have a minor quibble, the choice of films seems to have been reduced with many quite old. Is this BA's attempt to reduce costs, because it is quite obvious and detracts from the overall quality of their product. I was particularly impressed with the trouble the cabin staff took to warn us not to take any single-use plastic (e.g. water bottles, duty-free carrier bags) into the terminal where they could result in a stiff fine. Having been grumpy about several aspects of BA's service in the past, I will be writing to the leadership to thank them for the improvements."
918,✅ Trip Verified |  Athens to Los Angeles via London. Worst flight experience. I had a ticket from October travelling 1st December. 24hrs they decide to cancel the flight and give me the alternative for another flight 3 hrs later. Athens to Los Angeles via London same day. When arrive at London I realize from the announcement screen that my flight was operated. After I heard the announcement last call before departure. I checked at the BA information desk and confirm my flight (the one was cancelled) I asked them and reply: We found aircraft 12 hrs before and rescheduled flight. I send email and I had same response twice: Flight never operated or rescheduled. I think they had overbooked flight and didnt care about it.
919,"✅ Trip Verified |  Our return journey from Sydney to London, which was approximately 22 hours in duration with a stop at Singapore airport, was faced with one major issue. We flew economy class with a two year old, whose inflight entertainment headphone socket wasn’t working. Having paid £723 for our two year olds ticket, you would except the inflight entertainment to be working on such a long flight. Having complained to the cabin crew they did their best but unfortunately the socket could not be fixed. We were offered to move seats to the only 2 seats available however there were three of us so this was not practical. The cabin crew gave us some First Class goodies including a bottle of champagne for the inconvenience caused and they also said that all they could offer us in monitory terms was £25. They said they would contact BA customer services on our behalf to complain and to expect more compensation than what the crew could offer us. By the time we had got off the plane and were in baggage claim, I had already received an email from BA C/S and that they would respond within 48 hours, which they did. However, all the could offered was a £20 voucher to use on another BA flight. I replied declining this and said this was as insult to what we had originally paid for the flight and explained what the cabin crew had said. I also said I had no intention of booking any foreseeable flights with any airline therefore an eVoucher is worthless to me. There was no other alternative or any means of reasoning. The flight was basic and the seats were uncomfortable. BA also offer WiFi on the plane but when you try to use it, they charge £4.99 per hour in economy class."
920,"✅ Trip Verified | I had flown British Airways from Leeds Bradford to London Heathrow as a part of my journey back home (Thailand) on the 12th December 2018. I arrived at Leeds Bradford 3 hours early so there wasn't a queue at the check-in counter. Check-in process took less than a minute as I already done online check-in, this means I just dropped my luggage. The staff at the airport were very friendly and helpful. I passed through the security control and waited for my aircraft. Boarding process is a mess as there wasn't priority boarding (I flew economy) and no boarding groups, luckily every passenger could board through front and rear door (as the aircraft parked on a remote stand). The aircraft was old but the cabin was modern and clean. The seat was comfortable and had a good wing view. The only downside was the seat was the second to last row at the back so the seat pitch was short (luckily I was only 176m tall so this wasn't a problem). The aircraft was delayed due to slow boarding process and the weather condition, but the crew were very friendly and very helpful. The captain always announce an information for whole flight to let all passenger know the cause of delay and flight information. As the flight departed the crew started on board service. I didn't buy anything as the food option was poor, expensive and they can only be paid by credit cards. It was one hour flight so I didn't expect the top service standard. The flight arrived at London Heathrow on time despite some traffic. Overall, the flight service and crew made this flights enjoyable and to improve this the food and the boarding process should be better."
921,"Not Verified |  Gatwick to Tenerife. This aircraft either needs a refit or needs retiring! G-MEDK is by far the most uncomfortable plane I have ever been on. I paid extra for an extra leg room seat - 12A because I always feel happier without my knees under my chin for a four hour flight. I reckon it was no more than half an hour into my flight that the total lack of padding on the seat turned this flight into an ordeal. It was like sitting on concrete! I would imagine that when this aircraft was new (2005 I believe) the leather seating was quite yielding and comfortable but now with thirteen years of backsides compressing the padding, it was dreadful. I took the precaution of changing my seat for the return and sneaking on a seat pad purchased in Lanzarote which, coupled with there being no passengers next to me, made the flight in 11F a little more bearable. Staff were fine on the outward leg but a little tired by the time I returned at night ten days later. I normally travel Easyjet on this route but on this occasion, I used some Avios to make the flight less expensive. Easyjet offer two trolley runs but only 1 on these BA flights. With their diminishing attitude to customer welfare, I will not use BA on any lengthy flights as the service and comfort offered by Easyjet is, in my experience, far superior.
"
922,"✅ Trip Verified |  Booked a flight through Expedia for June 21019 from Denver to Paris via London on the promise that I could upgrade using Avios. After booking the flight and trying to upgrade, was notified that I could not upgrade the flight due to how I purchased the ticket, paid about $250 for early seat selection on both flights, after buy up to the front of the plane, was notified that my seats were changed to the back of the plane with no explanation, - but found out they gave the seats, that I paid extra for, to another party. Could request a refund, but wouldn't honor what they had sold me in the first place. They would not honor a refund either. Then I became ill and they chose not to refund my fare of $3380 plus paid for upgrades. "
923,"✅ Trip Verified |  Johannesburg to London. I had a bulkhead seat on the upper deck. The only advantage is that nobody will step over you during the night. BA has been using the same configuration of seats in business for the last 20 years, and it is time for them to step up their game if they want to keep people flying with them. The business class seat is not wider than the premium economy seat, the difference is that it goes to a full bed. There is no room or to put down a glass other then taking out the table. As it was a late flight (10pm), the crew decided not to offer pre-dinner drinks. I ordered the quick meal option in order to get more sleep. Big mistake: you only get the appetiser (tiny) and the desert (even smaller). I was still hungry and they refused to serve me my main dish as they reserved it for the crew. The trays are removed when everyone else finishes, so much for getting more sleep. The crew never came back until breakfast. That flight was a total disappointment."
924,"✅ Trip Verified | London to Kuala Lumpur. This is my first time flying with BA to Kuala Lumpur on the Dreamliner 787. Was very excited for this trip as BA has made a come back to fly to Malaysia after stopping the service for many years. I paid to seat at the first row to have a longer leg room. I absolutely regretted and disappointed for the choice. I made a complaint to the crew that my seat (30B) has sunk and I felt uncomfortable to be sitting on this seat for the next 13 hours. Crew only offered me an extra pillow to seat on it, which didn't help either. The tv screen on 30B was also not working and I didn't watch anything during the whole duration of the flight. I would recommend to totally avoid sitting on all row 30 as the seats are so close to the lavatories that you can hear toilets flusing at all time. This will be my last time flying with BA unless the aircraft is changed to perhaps the A380. I am dreading on my next return flight back to London. Crews were friendly and helpful. No fault with that."
925,✅ Trip Verified |  Los Angeles to London Heathrow. Very poor customer service. I checked in 3 hours prior to my flight departure asked  can I have aisle seat and she just said no. I asked her why and she replied that they don’t have any. In the plane there is no place for my bag and the staff said sorry sir we don’t have space and you can put that underneath your seat. They served dinner and said we don’t have any more chicken so you can have pasta. I told him I don’t like pasta and do you have any vegetarian food. He said the pasta is vegetarian. 
926,✅ Trip Verified |  Our flight from Seattle to London in November 6th was canceled due to technical problems. After waiting at the airport for 9 hours and staying in the line for 4 hours the BA associate couldn’t find us any immediate flight. They offered us a flight that would arrive in London late November 8th. It would take us 16 hours. Since the purpose of trip was to present a paper in a conference in November 8. I would have missed my presentation by the time we would arrive. My trip was supposed to be 4 days so by the time of arrival I had to return in less than two days. They advised us to cancel the flight and promised to refund our flight tickets as well as the expenses for our accommodation since it was to late to cancel our booking. I filed a claim online based on their instruction.  The customer relation phone number is disconnected. In fact the automatic voice mail says “please don’t chase a call”! The website link they refer to for tracking the claim has an auto message that the link dose not exist. After 1.5 months stressful attempt to connect with customer relations they finally responded by email to tell me that we are not going to receive any refund from them. 
927,"✅ Trip Verified |  Gatwick to Barbados. We flew out of Gatwick on the 6th December and back on the 17th Dec. It started well in the newish 1st Class lounge at the South terminal. However, the walk to the gate is miles. It has to be almost 1/2 mile walk which is a joke to be honest. The North terminal, where this flight used to operate from is not only a shorter walk for this flight, the decor and layout is much, much better. I'd guess BA got offered a cheaper deal to move to the S.T. My first impression was how badly the ""new"" 1st Class is holding up. There are scuff marks everywhere. Surface scratches. Bobbles of wear on the seat fabric. It's probably under 5 years of use but looks more like 10. In the WC there are small cracks in the plastic walls and brown stains. Needs a paint job at least. The motley flowers (That BA removed some years ago to save costs, but re-instated) are there. They looked like they had been pinched from a graveyard. Much has been said about the seat being ""an up market business class"" - and this is true. It is not a true 1st Class in the sense of what Emirates and Singapore Airlines offer. (I have flown both in 1st). The food is also business class quality. More casual dining rather than fine dining. Taking one meal; it starts with an Amuse Bouche. One motley round mozzarella bit of cheese. One tomato. One bit of green stuff. One straggly piece of prosciutto ham. Total cost about 30p. Outstanding! I then had prosciutto wrapped asparagus with garlic aioli and parmesan. Totally, utterly boring. My wife had the soup which she said was nice. I then had jerk Chicken dish. It was just about okay. The glassware and chinaware was okay. The cutlery was poor quality, the stuff you'd expect in Pizza Express, except the stuff in Pizza Express is better. I accept we are stuck with this 1st product for the next 30 years or so, but there is so much BA could do to improve the ""cheap"" look of their premium product. Quality of presentation, food, champagne, even the menu covers. They trumpet the ""superb"" Laurent Perrier Grand Siecle champagne, which retails at £120 a bottle. Its nice, but we all know this is inferior to what most Airline 1st Class offer in Krug. £20 a bottle more! The alternative to 1st is of course the ghastly ying-yang Club Business Class. The world's most hated Business Class in the sky. I'm a businessman and i know I could run this airline better, from a quality perspective. From a price perspective, if you bundle a 1st Flight as part of a BA holiday, it sort of works out okay-ish. The FAs as always were a very nice bunch of men and women."
928,"✅ Trip Verified |  Moscow to London. Fantastic first class service. The Moscow lounge was surprisingly good, with excellent Runway views. Quick boarding, and I was escorted to my seat by the crew. The new First seats on the 787-9 fleet are a real upgrade from the older product. There's plenty of space, a cupboard and several little storage bins in addition to the overhead bin space. The 23 inch flatscreen IFE screen offered brilliant picture quality and the sound quality was excellent thanks to the noise cancelling headphones. The dinner menu was extensive and the food fantastic, the best airline meal I've had. Drinks were constantly topped up from boarding to arrival. The crew were very attentive and friendly with it. A fantastic experience, and I'll look forward to my next opportunity to fly in this cabin."
929,"✅ Trip Verified |  Johannesburg to London . For supper I asked for warm / hot water to make milky drink as I don't drink tea or coffee for health reasons. Given with no problems. For breakfast I requested the same and I was refused. I explained I don't drink tea or coffee but milk and water."" We don't keep hot water, I can get it once we have finished serving all other customers"". That never came until the lady had to be called to take care of the unwell passenger. I kept my sugar, milk and stirring stick and asked another male cabin crew who was collecting trays after breakfast for the warm water, explaining I have been waiting. He said he will bring it in 5 seconds and he never came back. I felt like a nuisance, deliberately ignored and couldnt bother anyone and the flight started being bumpy in preparation for landing."
930,"✅ Trip Verified |  Bridgetown to Gatwick. Booked our return flight in Business/Club Class (at £1,000+ each) only to find BA want to charge an extra £80 each to choose our seats.  Awful seating with their Ying/Yang seating arranged like sardines in a tin. Poor cabin staff attitude - I asked for my seat to be made up into an bed only to be told ""We only do that in First class - if we did that for you we would have to do that for everyone in the cabin and we do not have the staff for that"". I was almost asleep when I was disturbed by food/drinks being passed through the serving hatch (otherwise known as a privacy screen) to the inner seat - This happened 3 times, a sort of sleep deprivation torture. If you are expecting business class levels of service, and the ability to sleep on an overnight flight you will be sadly disappointed."
931,"✅ Trip Verified |  Glasgow to New York via London. Morning flight from GLA to LHR was ok. I really miss the complimentary breakfast on the morning flights! We left on time and arrived in plenty of time to make our connection to JFK. On the JFK flight the service was fantastic. The meal was nice and we were offered plenty of drinks throughout the flight. We left and arrived on time. The seat and legroom was fine. My mothers IFE didn't work and she was moved seat, which she appreciated. The cabin crew were very friendly."
932,"✅ Trip Verified |  Sydney to London via Singapore. I'm hugely disappointed with the Business class trip. The seating arrangements leave little to be desired, i.e. if you are on the isle you're interrupted by the cabin crew passing food through to or collecting the tray from the person sitting on the inside of you (refer to seat guru for more understanding). Service is slow and once you have your food, good luck getting rid of your tray for about 45 minutes. If you're next to the window, you need to be extremely athletic to go to the toilet as you have to climb over someone legs in order to get out of your seat. The drinks available from the bar could not be less appealing if they tried and good luck trying to get one as the cabin crew are extremely elusive. If you do get a drink, be careful leaving it unattended on your pull out tray, I had two drinks slip off the Teflon type surface and spill all over my arm and seat. Dont get me started with the in-flight entertainment or the lack of it. After I watched two movies (on a 24 hour flight) I was scratching to find anything else decent to watch. The ""new releases"" is a contradiction in terms. There is very little priority giving to Business class when boarding the plane, sure you re called first but because of the plane’s configuration you ultimately have to join the queue to board with the rest of economy. Once you locate your seat you have all of economy filing passed you to get to their seats. I would not recommend BA to anyone."
933,"✅ Trip Verified |  Johannesburg to London. In contrast to our excellent outbound experience, inbound lacked the wow factor. The cabin was full and dominated by a few passengers who seemed to want to demonstrate their importance. Cabin crew were adequate rather than outstanding. The dinner service was unremarkable, too, and the cheese board had shrunk in size between the two flights. My IFE touchscreen struggled to respond to finger presses and the selection of films was no different to the previous month. Sleep quality was reasonable, although the high cabin temperature made the duvet redundant. Breakfast was pretty good. Arrival was on time and we were relieved to find that our bags had made their way from a domestic Comair flight."
934,"✅ Trip Verified |  Antigua to Gatwick. One of the worst business class experience. Entertainment system didn't work and asked the crew for solution and their reply was sorry sir there is no solution. Service super slow 2-3 crew to serve 48 business class passengers. Food bad, beef over cooked, mashed potatoes dry and salad disgusting. Nobody from the crew to help us to prepare our bed. Woke up 20min before landing and offered a yogurt. "
935,"✅ Trip Verified |  Gatwick to Barbados. First class was third rate. A disgusting cabin, crumbs on the seat, dirty carpets and finger marks over the controls - it looked as though it hadn't been properly cleaned for days. Poor service and an entertainment system from a different age. I have avoided flying with BA for the last 20 years, now I remember why. Avoid them if your route allows."
936,"✅ Trip Verified |  Cape Town to London. Very unimpressive amenities and service. Unless you have a bulkhead seat, there is no way to leave the seat without either stepping over someone or having them step over you. There is a small storage drawer but nowhere to stow even small carry-on baggage except in the bin above. The food was at best pedestrian and no wine was served with dinner except by request and then it took ages to get. My husband got no cutlery on his tray and couldn't get the attention of steward to rectify (I gave him one of the two sets on mine). I, on the other hand never got the main course. I finally went and asked and it was delivered cold and over-cooked."
937,"✅ Trip Verified |  Bucharest to London. They are not giving free food and drinks anymore, you have to pay on short haul. In Bucharest they did not park at the terminal, they shuttle us to and from the plane in the bus. They are charging for checked luggage and ask people to check their hand luggage because 'the flights are too busy'. Avios loyalty reward points will buy you a lot less than it used to. I have no problem with BA turning into a budget airline, but at least charge accordingly, otherwise, it feels like we're being scammed."
938,"✅ Trip Verified | Kuala Lumpur to Mexico City via London. The journey from Malaysia to Mexico alone for business trip would be very boring. However, during my trip from London to Mexico City on 2 Dec 2018, it is quite interesting with the cabin crew facilitating me, especially associated with Muslim needs on food. They are polite and talk to me with big smiles. So, when I returned back to Malaysia and transit in London from Mexico City on 5 Dec 2018, I wished I will be able to meet them again. Hope to see this wonderful cabin crew team again in my next trip."
939,"✅ Trip Verified |  Miami to London. BA are going downhill . Having been offered chicken curry of vegetable pasta on the outward journey, the choice was exactly the same this time.  I explained to the steward that I didn’t like either choice and was it possible to have a salad or some soup from another class but I was told by an extremely rude steward that I could like it or lump it basically. He said I should have put my requests on my account but you can’t account for having the same two options every time you travel and wouldn’t expect them only to have two menus.  The snack before landing was the most disgusting bagel/bun. Totally unacceptable and as for the attitude of the staff, making a bad situation worse. The light didn’t work on my seat so I couldn’t read once the lights went off and the screen was so damaged on my TV, watching was incredibly hard. Entertainment having travelled four times in last month, films have barely changed. I won’t be travelling with them again if at all possible."
940,"✅ Trip Verified | 
I would like to compliment British Airways and their crew for the comfort of the flight, service from the crew and the food served. Before landing we were served with an afternoon tea plate that was a credit to the catering company. Overall a very enjoyable flight from London Gatwick to Tampa."
941,"✅ Trip Verified | Arrived at the airport to discover the flight had been delayed by several hours. During this time no clear information was available from the check-in desk (who were unable to confirm the delay) or elsewhere at the airport. Over an hour after the flight should have taken off, and after most people had purchased refreshments, an announcement was made that each passenger would be entitled to a snack from an airport cafe - however no refunds were provided for the majority of us who had already done so. No complimentary food or drink was provided on board to make up for the delay. We landed at Gatwick minutes before the last train left, meaning we then had to shell out £50 for a taxi home. Despite this, BA refused to pay any compensation as the delay was less than three hours (2 hours 55 minutes to be exact!) and took over a month to respond to my request about it. This airline has been going downhill for several years but this experience cements BA's transformation into an overpriced EasyJet. Will not fly with them again."
942,"✅ Trip Verified |  We have been loyal customers with British Airways since I was a little girl. Every summer we booked airline tickets with this company to visit my grandparents in Italy. On October 17th I booked 3 airline tickets to visit my grandparents leaving October 31st coming back November 12th as my grandfather was very sick and didn’t have much longer to live. On October 19th my grandfather passed away. We put in a cancellation/refund request because the sole purpose was to see him one last time. As British Airways did refund us for our tickets but refused to refund us $150 of our seats even though we never used their services. This has been frustrating to deal with on top of the loss of my grandfather. In addition, every employee we have spoken to on the phone had probably the worse customer service experience I’ve ever encountered.  I am beyond disappointed with this company and neither my family nor I will fly with them in the future. "
943,"✅ Trip Verified |  Gatwick to Las Vegas. Boarding by group number seemed to work well at Gatwick, we took off ahead of schedule and service commenced about 45 min after take off. The crew seemed relaxed and happy and worked well as a team. BA have improved their inflight menu and it shows as the quality of the food was one of the best I’ve ever had on a long haul flight. The aircraft was old and dated and the IFE was a throwback to the 90’s with unresponsive touch screen and hard to watch quality as we all so used to HD quality these days. All in all a very enjoyable flight."
944,"Not Verified |  Nassau to London. Premium Economy on BA is a joke. Highlighted by my Friday morning 7am breakfast. A glass of water and a breakfast box containing a cold, sealed in plastic, Croissant and an equally sealed Banana Bread/Cake. No hot food/drink; awful. That after a night battling with intermittent service on the seat back screen,  a screen no larger than in Economy. The only benefit for the money was early off the plane with luggage prioritised to the collection area. The extra leg room was about OK but the seat was simply uncomfortable for a 6/2 225lb male - yes large but not obese. BA Premium Economy - forget it. Other airlines do this better."
945,✅ Trip Verified |  Phoenix to Accra via London. I had a great Customer service treatment at the check in at Phoenix by the young lady who checked me in. She was very professional and handled my check in process excellently. My entire trip was great and I really was treated very well also on my final leg to Accra by the BA staff in London as well. Just want to appreciate this gesture of professionalism by the staff.
946,"✅ Trip Verified |  Manchester to London. The bag drop process took an hour even though I had checked in already. The staff offered little apology, explaining that there was a big group ahead and they could do nothing about this. Staff on the flight were clumsy and rude - one attendant dropped a water bottle on my shoulder and offered the merest apology. Another flight attendant didn’t bother to ask customers in the last rows if they wanted refreshments. Not exactly best of British, and I’ll certainly not be recommending!"
947,"✅ Trip Verified |  San Diego to Hannover via London. I booked on ba.com, the longer flights both ways in premium economy.  On the return I was informed at San Diego that the American Airlines flight into DFW was severely delayed and I would miss my flight into London. American Airlines could book me on a later flight the same day, but had only  coach available. If I insisted on premier economy I could fly in 3 days. I took the coach and American assured my that BA would refund the fare difference for this downgrade. After arrival at home I contacted BA on their website to refund the fare difference. A bizarre exchange followed. First they said you did not buy any upgraded seat. I told them to look at the ticket. You can't get a refund because the economy class seat was much more expensive that the booked premium economy seat. I contacted BA Germany who said you get a refund, but you booked this with a travel agent, so we are not in charge.  I booked with BA on their website. They saidthey would send this to London so they can compute the refund, but then you can't get a refund because your seat was much more expensive than the premium seat you booked months in advance. The change in booking was the sole fault of the delayed American Airlines flight. This is miserable customer service."
948,✅ Trip Verified |  London Heathrow to Stuttgart. Absolutely disgusted with BA. my husband was asked to put his one piece of hand luggage in the hold due to the flight being busy and he agreed. BA had one job to do - put it in the hold and make sure it arrives in Stuttgart. This has proven too difficult. The bag is lost and they have not offered any assistance or support.
949,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Johannesburg. Turning right to the first wing at T5 was a new experience for us. It was all pretty slick, although the guy at check-in wasn't exactly Mr Convivial. The Concorde Room was impressive, too - particularly the terrace with its quirky interior design, overlooking the main concourse. Boarding involved lining up according to group. This smacked a bit of low-cost airlines, but I guess that's necessary with all the passengers on a double-decker plane. The first cabin on the A380 is definitely more spacious than on a 747 and the 'suites' also had more room and extra storage space. The dividers seemed higher, too, giving better privacy. The fact that the cabin was only half full was another bonus. Cabin crew were friendly, attentive and thoroughly professional. Food was good, too, and demonstrated that airline food can be of restaurant quality if the cabin crew use reheating facilities properly. The wines on offer were a good selection, including the fabulous LPGS, and we enjoyed some wine tasting. Sleep quality was considerably better than Club World, although the cabin temperature was a little high. Overall, an excellent flight that fully met the brief of first class travel."
950,"✅ Trip Verified |  Having booked BA Business Class and paid extra for the seat selection on the Boeing 787, I was disappointed to have the flight re-scheduled. I rejected BA's offer of flying on Belgian Air and had to change my flight to get a different BA aircraft. When I booked in the window seat selections had been lost. My husband and I were forced to sit separately. At the booking in I was told that they could not find ""proof"" that I had paid for selected seats. I could not prove the payment because the booking number had changed with the new flights. Spooning with a stranger in the centre isle was not the trip I planned. On the return flight (again, sitting apart from my husband) my TV did not work. The staff could not have been nicer, but could not find an alternative seat. On return, BA customer complaints offered a £400 voucher on my next flight. Despite sending two detailed messages, I received the same response. Completely inadequate service by BA (not the flight attendants) in delivering the flights I paid for and dealing with the complaints."
951,"✅ Trip Verified |  Vancouver to London Heathrow. I chose to fly with them because I had been told they were good for families and as I was traveling with my 8 month old alone this was what I needed. The booking process was not smooth and very stressful, I have to call customer service multiple times and they need to improve their customer service call center. The 2 flights were great though, the staff both on the ground and in the air were very helpful and did everything they could to ensure I was doing ok. The crew came around often with drinks and the food was ok I was first given a cot for my baby. I originally wanted a one of the Britax seats they have but was talked out it saying my baby would be more comfortable in the cot, nope! He was too big and could not lie straight so I asked for it to be switched out and he was asleep with 15 minutes. All the toilets in economy were out of order at least 3 hours before we reached our destination so everyone had to used the business class toilets, I'm sure that was annoying for the people seated there and lines were constant."
952,"✅ Trip Verified |  Boston to Nairobi via London. The only good thing was the new and clean looking plane for the first leg of the trip from Boston to Heathrow. The cabin crew service was below standard. I had a window seat and twice I was passed up and not offered anything to eat/drink while everyone around me was, simply because I was watching a movie. I  noticed that if you didn't have eye contact with the attendant you were not offered anything. Airplane food is not exactly gourmet but BA food was so bland even the little I ate was only because I was hungry. The connecting flight from Heathrow to Nairobi was  worse because the plane was the  opposite of the one from Boston to Heathrow. It looked beat up and lacked even the basics like a USB port. Cabin crew service on this leg was  below standard. I'm probably to blame because I overrated BA before flying with them but now I know better. "
953,"✅ Trip Verified |  Basel to San Fransisco via Heathrow. I'm convinced the quality has dropped considerably in the past several years. I booked World Traveller Plus or Premium Economy which costs appr. twice as much as economy. The flight to SFO was ok seat wise as the plane was an A380 and I has reserved an aisle seat. The food was disgusting for me, during the flight we were given a box with several pieces of junk food and shortly before landing given a piece of pizza. The choice of food leaves a lot to be desired. There were cold drinks offered regularly and you can go to the bulkhead to get extra if needed. We were offered maybe two hot drinks during the 12 hours on the plane (longer due to a delay leaving the UK). The flight back to the UK was worse since it was a Boeing 747 with the older bulkier seats. You couldn't even get to the remote control hidden in the inside of the seat and I'm not big. The recliner didn't work properly and the general space around the seat is cramped as the person next to me spilled over to my seat. I feel sorry for larger people. The food was just as bland and poor and barely any warm drinks. The staff seem challenged with certain situations. Next time I'm off to the US I will look for an alternative airline."
954,✅ Trip Verified |  London to Lyon. The flight has 1h 30 delay for a flight duration of 1:30. Ground staff forced me to check-in my suitcase during boarding process due to lack of space in the plane and I got my suitcase damaged with 2 big cuts on the back. Then the customer service has been very useless. Such a very bad experience. I do not recommend flying with them.
955,✅ Trip Verified |  London to Boston. I was seated next to a customer who was needed an extra seat. The flight attendant was extremely nice and helpful and ensured I was comfortable throughout the flight. Superb Customer Service.
956,✅ Trip Verified | Stockholm to London. Standard configuration on short haul European flights. Business class still 3 seats each side of the isle. Middle seat fitted with a tray. Had a wonderful crew with 2 super professional stewards in business. Drinks served with a smile and the food also. Food reminding of what was served in economy 10 years ago when there still was free there. The best part of the meal was the cheese and pudding.
957,"✅ Trip Verified |  Amsterdam to London arrived 33 minutes late - three delays, taking off, landing, and getting the walkway to the airplane. This has happened twice this year. I fly KLM 90% of the time on this route and am delayed very rarely. I fly British on this route  when it is significantly cheaper but am delayed. I’m sure it’s bad luck but if you do better than double the flight time you are having a good day. "
958,"✅ Trip Verified |  Buenos Aires to London. We flew overnight Friday 9th November. The plane seating is worn out and uncomfortable, there were large numbers or Argentinian passengers on the plane yet I saw no staff that spoke Spanish. The chicken dinner was described as Curry but there was no sauce on it. The bread roll was stale and dessert stodgy, During the night no water was offered to me. It was not possible to charge electronic equipment, the seatback screens were small with a limited choice of entertainment."
959,"✅ Trip Verified |  Business Class space is ridiculously narrow. Service is very careless. You are not allowed laptops on the flight from Riyadh, so you cannot work if you want to. You cannot choose when to eat."
960,"✅ Trip Verified |  Aberdeen to Heathrow to connect to a flight in Gatwick the day after. During check-in using the BA app, there was a problem that I had to re-start, after that when I opened noted that the boarding pass was issued not allowing me to add a bag in the hold. After calling BA and explaining the situation was told that the option was to pay £65 at the airport desk. What a rip off for a short flight. By curiosity I checked with Easyjet and if I had booked with them for the same day would had cost me the same to fly as the money BA asked for the bag."
961,"✅ Trip Verified | I would not recommend this airline. I travel a lot for work and get to fly different airlines so have a good base to compare it to. Baggage Allowance: Only give you 23kgs of checked baggage and if you are 1 kg over (regardless if your other bags with your other travel companions are under) you have to pay $170AUD extra. This is the strictest airline I have ever used. All other airlines have allowed up to 5kgs over at no charge. Ensure you have pre-weighed all bags. In-flight meal: On the way to Sydney, they served soggy squashed sandwiches as a meal. It is an 8 hour flight! Make sure you pack your own snacks/meal. You don't get a bottle of water and they rarely serve drinks. Make sure you pre-pack a bottle or two once you are through customs. Customer service: From the get go the customer service was appalling. It is hard enough traveling with kids, but having to deal with BA was stressful. They wouldn't allow me to swap my ticket with my husband as we were traveling with my kids and I had a slight delay which meant I couldn't go on the same flight. At the airport, they couldn't find my children's booking which caused further delay and stress. How do you misplace 4 kids on the same booking? They then put my husband in a seat not with all of us and wouldn't do anything to help change this. We had to ask the person next to my kids once on the plane on our own. Don't bother flying BA."
962,"✅ Trip Verified |  New York to Budapest via London. The second flight was a bit different. The plane was clean, but cold. I wanted to drink water, but the cabin crew does not accepted my request. By mistake the captain welcomed the passengers to Bucharest and not Budapest."
963,"✅ Trip Verified |  Heathrow to Athens on A321. Arrived at the airport in time and bag drop was an ease. Got to the gate within 30mins of bag drop with light security queues. On the aircraft, there was sufficient seat legroom for my seat 7F.  A funny safety video played and the flight was smooth. No food was served, except some M&S, BBC news was playing on the screens, with no sound and Russian captions, quite confusing. The plane landed half an hour late, but it was the best landing I have ever experienced."
964,"✅ Trip Verified | London to Bangkok. I am not a fan if the BA configuration in Business. However I did have seat 2J so it was right up front. I am not sure where to begin. Food awful, I ordered beef (a showcase of British beef the notes said) that was inedible I left most of it. Instead of asking was something wrong or would I like another meal option, the FA took the tray away and asked if I wanted dessert. Wine 2 reds 2 whites and 2 champagnes - hardly a stellar wine list. Entertainment small screen with dreadful resolution and a very limited ordinary range of options. Staff challenged at best, clearly some had not been in business before. Disengaged and disinterested. The cabin was over hill for me. The toilet was not checked very often, a sweet wrapper remained on the toilet floor the entire trip as did an overflowing rubbish bin. I would expect much better up the front of the plane we pay a premium to be there and the service and overall product do not match expectations. "
965,"✅ Trip Verified |  Abu Dhabi to London. Although a BA flight, this sector was operated by Air Belgium and offered a really poor experience. Aircraft felt old and tired, cabin crew were totally indifferent, cabin temperature was too hot and stuffy and food totally inedible. A really awful flight and worth looking at alternatives if you need to fly this route in the near future."
966,"✅ Trip Verified |  Gatwick to Orlando. Stains on the seat, cotton buds in the seat well. Disgusting and had to force them to clean. No entertainment on board, it was not functional. Internet available at three times Emirates price and twice AA flight and speed that won’t achieve streaming. When I complained to BA they told me I couldn’t communicate with the CEO but I could connect with their customer relations. I have been Gold on BA for thirty years and it’s time to ditch this 
non responsive airline."
967,"✅ Trip Verified | Newcastle to Las Vegas via London. Both my flights were great, on time and the food was good on the flight to London, and a nice bottle of champagne as well. My long haul flight was also good, aircraft was 20yrs old but clean, cabin crew were very nice, friendly and efficient, my pre ordered meal was absolutely fantastic, the only complaint I can have is the in flight entertainment needs to be improved, ie, try showing some classic British comedy programmes instead of the unfunny modern stuff, and also include some good classic rock music that people have actually heard of, apart from that, absolutely great, well recommended."
968,"✅ Trip Verified |  While it is still fresh in my mind, I’d like to commend the hard working crew of my BA flight from St.Petersburg to London Heathrow on 23rd October 2018. The check-in staff were very professional and helpful and assisted me with a query. Boarding was operated remarkably efficiently and in a precise and orderly manner. The cabin crew were welcoming and very professional in their appearance and demeanor too. The cabin was spotlessly clean and the flight departed on time and arrived slightly early. The captain was informative. My only gripe was the lack of a route map on this flight and the M&S buy on board option was a bit tedious. Disembarkation was equally well managed and passengers were fare welled in a courteous and sincere way. This flight has restored my faith in BA. Well done to the superb crew!"
969,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Philadelphia. I upgraded from coach to business for almost $900 because I  wanted to experience BA’s business class in the Boeing 787, but I was disappointed. While the aircraft was new, the staff really could have cared less about the business guests. 2-3-2 in business with some seats facing the cockpit and others the tail. BA lost me as a traveler because the crew although polite, service wise was lacking. Pre-flight they offer you a beverage, I asked for rose champagne and I was told “I guess I have to go find a bottle and open one”. In my previous business class experiences there are beverages served every 2 hours, not on this almost 8 hour flight. I was served my main meal almost 2.5 hours after takeoff. You get one full hot meal and a snack one hour and a half before landing. You also get an initial beverage and then the next time a beverage is offered is 1.5 hours before landing. If you ask for anything else to drink in between you have to go into the galley. Yes they have the menu, linen, silverware and glass but you feel like they just have to do this for you and not like they want to do this for you. Because of the extra seat they cram into business now they are all very narrow and really uncomfortable. There was virtually no storage other than a small laptop droor and that’s it. I have to say the entertainment options were very good and there was no Wi-Fi on this flight. You get a pillow, duvet and blanket and a decent amenity kit. BA has the new planes, and decent business amenities however they lost me in the service. I will not pay to upgrade to business on BA and will avoid flying with them if I have another option. They need to improve when it comes to inflight experiences and treatment specially for their business class travelers."
970,✅ Trip Verified | Madrid to London. Good improvement. This BA club Europe flight was on a B777 so seats were flat beds. BA have updated their menus so instead of serving a sandwich they offered a full meal service. Three choices of main and food was good quality. Good BA listened to feedback. They were as always let down by their Iberia partners in that their Madrid business lounge was abysmal as usual. With no toilets available and the lone tortilla as the unique culinary offering along with dirty tables
971,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Munich. The ground staff were very friendly and the plane was clean. Once boarding was completed we were informed that due to issues with the tower the flight would be delayed by 40 minutes. They hadn't finished loading the baggage and this was clear from the view out of the window, where you could see bags still arriving and being loaded after our scheduled departure. Aircrew were functional but this must have been the last flight of the day and you noticed it. Flight was uneventful they had the flight tracking screen down for 30 minutes before they retracted. Other than being lied to as to the reason for the delay the flight offered the minimum required."
972,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Cape Town.  Waiting at gate, the staff announced flight will be delayed because cabin temperature is too high. Air conditioning problem on board. She said all doors of aircraft have been opened, lights dimmed or switched off to decrease temperature, boarding will start as soon as possible. Finally one hour after take off temperature became acceptable. "
973,"✅ Trip Verified | Full flight from MUC to LHR with British Airways. On the plus side the ground and cabin crew are very friendly, so is the baggage allowance, plane although not new was clean. You have to pay for your food and beverages on board short haul flights. The departure was delayed by 45 minutes and a further delay on arrival for a total of 55 minutes later than expected. We also parked at a gate at the very far end of T5. The plus side of all the walking was that the luggage was there waiting for us. Service as expected for the price and that would be the reason for choosing them again. When traveling with an infant the delays tend to compound matters."
974,"✅ Trip Verified |  Manchester to Philadelphia via London. MAN-LHR I am not tall so the Club Europe seating is fine for me on a short flight. Addressed by name - adequate breakfast of bacon roll, fruit and yoghurt. Concorde Room not crowded and no wait for showers. LHR-PHL on aged 747 but still my favorite - cabin/washrooms in very good shape though. I have no problem with the BA F layout unlike so many posters here. Excellent flight - experienced crew and though full cabin, all very smooth and professional. Beautifully prepared and presented lamb shank, good wines as always - nice to see a good British bubbly included. Only downside was deplaning in PHL where F passengers had to fight their way off through the J scrum - could have been controlled by crew, but was not."
975,✅ Trip Verified |  Bangkok to London. Seating and interior old with a very small IFE screen. I did not like the meals. Had a short connection and i was rebooked from another partner. Upon arrival in LHR others for the same connecting flight were awaited but not me. I was told there would be service agents in purple everywhere but I found none. The fast track security was non existant. Total experience was bad.
976,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Toronto. 14 day trip to play golf with my Father, and BA lost my clubs for 7 days. Dealing with BA lost luggage/customer service was brutal, they had no idea where my clubs were or how long it would take to retrieve them. I had packed all my clothes with my clubs. First days of trip were to buy clothes and essentials. Flight home from LHR-YYZ was an old 777 with a misplaced seat cushion, and a broken seat that wouldn't stay upright. The IFE system badly needs upgrading, and no power ports at the seats - grueling 7.5hr flight. As bad as I thought Air Canada was they are light years ahead of BA. "
977,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Vienna. I was shocked that BA provides buy onboard short haul flights - no free water, coffee or tea. I tried to buy something but my Credit Card wouldn't work, and I could not pay with cash."
978,"✅ Trip Verified |  Johannesburg to London. I tend to stay with an airline as a frequent flyer and I fly business class. I have seen a change for the worst in BA service, and it does not seem to get any better. Bedding finally a decent pillow, a very good one indeed. The rest is a waste of money unless a new announced Club World seat is introduced where all this will fit perfectly.  Seated in a window seat makes it  impossible to make up a bed properly with them new things. I don't expect top food in a plane but I expect service. If you announce things, make sure you have them. On some flights Champagne is not being served when you have taken your seat. Premium economy however gets a sparkling wine.  You must eat when they order you to eat. They seem to have run out of certain items such as a gin other than Gordon's. You have to decide upon breakfast before you even had dinner. Entertainment, make sure you bring your tablet with downloaded things to view. BA offers you the most limited offer."
979,"✅ Trip Verified |  Singapore to London Heathrow. It's my first time traveling on British Airways. The seat arrangement in its long-haul business class is very uncommon that half of the seats are facing backward. So you are face-to-face with the one sitting opposite you (at least during taking off and landing when the divider is lowered down). There are 8 Club World seats per row for 777-300ER, which is relatively narrower if comparing with other carriers serving this route. The cabin service was as good as expected. However, I saw only chocolate bars and sweets for the minibar during night. There could be some other choices."
980,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Los Angeles. Booked this trip eight months previously and as I lost my status on BA a few years ago were forced to pay an additional £180 for our two seats. The flight I chose was a Boeing 787 and was prepared to part with the extra cash so we could be in the small front cabin. Never expecting anything to go according to plan with BA and our flight was cancelled a few days before. We were rebooked onto a later flight which they changed from an A380 to a twenty one year old Jumbo. We were then seated right at the back of Club World to benefit from a screaming child sat in the front row of premium. We were greeted by a rather pleasant steward who told us he would be looking after us for the trip, he then disappeared never to be seen again. Food was served within an hour of take off for an eleven hour flight. The steak so tough was it impossible to cut and could only be eaten by picking up and biting pieces off. After a few hours I went  to the galley to seek out a drink as the crew had disappeared, stood there being completely ignored by three stewardesses. Reluctantly one stopped chattering and managed to get me a drink. The second meal was served about seven hours after lunch, steak sandwich, at least that one was edible. The seat was as you would expect on such an old plane totally knackered, getting out was a task in itself. I bought WiFi for the whole trip, it ran for about 50% of the flight, yet their customer (non existent) services refuse to refund the payment even though I sent them a whole host of screenshots showing at various times there was no wifi service, but they are happy to note the problems. We have avoided BA now for some time, except where there is no other option as on Club Europe. But with transatlantic they are probably the bottom of the pile. We only took this trip to use up some Avios, they have all been used now and we could come back from LAX on Virgin Atlantic. Never again, BA club world offered is a farce in today's business market."
981,"✅ Trip Verified |  Miami to London Heathrow. As with many others whom have posted reviews on this site my issue is with BA's customer service when dealing with an issue that has arisen from flying on this once proud airline. My issue was with faulty equipment onboard. Issue with my seat that the onboard team tried to the best of their ability to sort but unable to through no lack of effort and have nothing but praise for these guys working with aging equipment and keep on trying to do their best to keep the customer happy. Had to move seat and as first, club and premium economy all full, had to move back to economy. Asked customer services to refund me the fare difference for this part of the journey and after several cut and past generic replies on their part and fed up hitting my head off a brick wall have given up as life is too short to fight profits over customer satisfaction organisation. Following a favourable review of my outward journey it is clear BA lacks consistency and don't wish to deal with issue when something goes wrong. As i said in both my reviews nothing but praise for the onboard crews dealing with these issues and trying to make it a great experiance but think BA now need to work on their problem solving skills. I now have 91000 Avios going to waste as my business will be going else where."
982,"Not Verified | London Heathrow to Milan Malpensa. Worst airline I’ve ever dealt with. I fly 100+ times a year. British Airways lost my and my wife’s luggage on our vacation. They have been unbelievably rude and unhelpful in resolving this issue. They have ruined our vacation and refuse to help us. Please, never book this airline."
983,"Not Verified |  Calgary to Rome via London. My wife and I booked our 10th anniversary trip from Calgary to Rome return, with British Airways, Sept 17-27. This was my first trip in Europe, and we spent almost $8500 CAD on first class tickets. The flight Calgary to London (stopover) was ok. I got a bottle of water, and then nobody came to the pod I was in for the next 8 hours. One would have expected more from first class, maybe another bottle of water? They asked me to fill out what I would like for breakfast on a card. I filled it out but no breakfast or even coffee came. The vacation itself was great. On the day of the return flight, our Trenitalia train broke down in Naples, and we were 80 mins late. My wife tried dozens of times to phone British Airways but none of their phone numbers posted on the website were working; most of the calls were just dropped and some were out of service. We tried the numbers from our tickets, their website, their help desk, Facebook page, Google etc. We tried at least 5 different phone numbers a half dozen times each over the 90 mins, and could not get through. My wife managed to check herself in online, but could not check me in. There was a glitch on the computer saying they needed my passport to check in, once my wife pressed my name, the passport information was already on the form and said form is complete. It was a computer glitch we couldn't get around.  Ultimately we arrived at the Rome airport 5 mins too late for me to check in. My wife was ok and could go through but I could not. We asked the 3 ladies at the British Airways desk for help, and they shrugged and said they couldn't help us. Apparently, they said it would have been different if we called before, and we showed them her phone (see the attached photos) with all the calls we made. They then told us it was a ticket kiosk only and they couldn't reschedule us. They gave us another number to call My wife at this point was near tears. I am visually impaired and had eye surgery just 2 weeks prior, so I was not allowed to carry over 5 lbs. She was managing all the luggage, the ticketing etc and after 10 hours of delays she was very stressed. The attitude of these ladies certainly did not help in any way. The new secret customer service phone number we were given did work, and my wife was on the phone with Customer Service for over an hour. After reviewing the details with several teams of specialists, we were told basically that they didn't believe us that we tried to call, they were not interested in us sending screenshots of us trying to call. Nothing could be done for us, and they could only rebook us for $8800. No apologies whatsoever were given, nor the slightest help or accommodation for us being stranded in Rome. We eventually made it home on different airlines but I have lost all respect and trust for British Airways. Like any corporation they are only interested in taking your money while making minimal effort to customer support."
984,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Bangkok. Flew British Airways for the first time in a couple of years. Terminal 5 is rubbish. It may look great, but you have to travel further using the train services to get there, and once there you may find that after check in you need to travel  again on another train  to  T5a or b as they are again separate  sections of terminal 5. I usually fly EVA and others from Terminal 2 and I would avoid T5 if possible from now on. The aircraft interior was old and dated, the seats had seen better days and the tv screen was about the size of an iPhone 8+ (without the technology). The food was ok at best, served cold to warm on both meals on both flights. The crew were okay on the flight home, however on the flight out they were not interested when you spoke to them. Landing cards for Thailand were loaded on the aircraft in a total of about 50 so most people in economy had to land in Bangkok and spend time filling one in just before immigration which is ridiculous as the queue is always huge at Bangkok and you want to just get on with clearing through and getting your bag. The flight had some drunks on the way back to the UK, and while this isn’t the airlines fault, I did notice that when one young guy of about 21 was told no more alcohol by the cabin manager (he kicked off) the next crew member did serve him. This is the last time by choice I will ever fly British Airways, if there’s no seats available anywhere else (which is why I went with them this time), then I guess I’ll have no choice."
985,"✅ Trip Verified |  London Heathrow to Miami. The airport staff was very helpful, the crew was also very nice and the food was delicious. I had the old personal entertainment system but it works very well. Overall it was one of the best flights I had."
986,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Singapore. It was a wonderful flight.  I was lucky having a 2-seats-row for my own on the upperdeck, but that was only the last criteria to make the flight perfect. The crew was very friendly and the food was the best I've had on an airplane. If you fly the A380 in economy, book seats in the upperdeck. Best seats on the plane: 83A or 83K."
987,"Not Verified | Dublin to London. I was trying to add additional bag online but system was keep saying that my email address is not correct, but I was giving completely correct email address. When I checked in my flight then additional bag option was completely gone and system asked me to add additional bag from airport charging me €70 as compare to €35 online price. Afterwards I phoned customer care to discuss the issue, customer care agent has dropped my call three times. On fourth time I was talking one of the customer care agent. He was not helpful at all, then I asked him to connect me with his supervisor or manager, they put me on hold for about 55 mins and said manager is busy. This is completely unprofessional and was showing no empathy. British Airways is trying to rob me by compelling me to pay double price at airport for extra baggage. British Airways was always my first priority. Unfortunately, I won’t be flying again with British Airways due to this awkward behavior."
988,"✅ Trip Verified | London - Pisa (Return). I fly this route often as we have a house in Tuscany. This, in all reasonableness was the best so far - but only just. Outbound we went through the ""First"" wing check in at T5. (We are Gold card members). The breakfast we had in the lounge was just about OK. The South lounge was rammed. We took off on time and I declined a cooked breakfast. The lady next to me had a full English and it did look rather nice. The Captain popped out for the loo, and I caught his eye and enjoyed a pleasant ten minutes or so chat about aviation. A very nice bloke, who landed the plane superbly. Coming home, we were delayed by 45 minutes due to storm Ali. We had a very good lunch with the new Club Europe menu which came into effect two days earlier. A nice prawn cocktail and a very nice coronation Chicken. Downed a couple of G&Ts. FAs on both flights were great. There has been a massive improvement here on the catering side. The seating is still hopeless. Three seats between two and zero legroom. BA really should look at the competition in the Far East who offer excellent regionalized business class. The product is only worth it in a Sale or Avious points. The every day fare price is ludicrous."
989,"✅ Trip Verified |  I was in Prague flying British Airways back to Heathrow. Apparently there were thunderstorms in London so the flights were being delayed. My 17:15 flight was delayed until 8 am the next morning. There was no British Airways person at the Prague airport to relay this message: some consolidator passed out sheets of paper advising people of the remuneration available to them should they spend the night and wait for the 8 am flight. The sheet of information didn't offer any hotel suggestions or ideas of how to get back into Prague. This consolidator also mentioned that there was a 20:00 flight and there was room for thirty people on this flight. So after calling British Airways and finding  their offices were  closed for the evening, I went  online and booked the flight. Because of the late timing, I was charged $356USD. Then after countless emails and hours spent trying to get through on the phone, I finally learned that BA would only reimburse me the non-used flight that I had booked 3 months earlier- at a cost of $96 USD. They also said they would send me a $50 flight voucher: not sure how many months it will take until I receive it. Is there any other airline that doesn't simply rebook a significantly delayed passenger on the next flight and not try to extract outrageous sums from them? I will never fly British Airways again."
990,"✅ Trip Verified | 
BA34 KUL-LHR 6 Sept, return BA11 LHR-SIN-KUL on 16 Sept. All flights in World Traveller Plus with the exception of SIN-KUL on MH economy. On the KUL-LHR leg, the aircraft was clean and spacious in the PY cabin. The seats were the biggest let down. Whilst there was adequate legroom, they were hard and uncomfortable, especially when reclined with virtually no lumbar support. The headrest did not move at all. The seats taper at the waist which is odd and given that they are quite wide, there is very little storage apart from the usual pocket which I think is a missed opportunity by BA to maximise utilisation of space. The food was okay, you get two meals, the first being quite substantial but the second was a joke. IFE was okay but the best part of the journey was the staff who were pleasant and obliging. The return flight was on an A380. Excellent boarding procedure as it was a full flight. Again, seats were the same but the A380 has that wonderful storage space on the upper cabin. Staff were less conspicuous this time around. Overall, I would recommend them but attention needs to be paid to their seats."
991,✅ Trip Verified | We flew from Los Angeles to Leeds Bradford via Heathrow on Thursday 13th September with British Airways and codeshare partner American Airways. We arrived safely but our bags did not. It is now Monday afternoon and after receiving five different text messages contradicting each previous one we are still without our bags. Come on BA sort this shambles out.
992,"✅ Trip Verified |  Brindisi to London. Flying from any airport that includes Ryanair among its serving airlines has to be a bad sign. Brindisi airport is at least modern but it makes few concessions to comfort and there was certainly no lounge for Club Europe passengers. There was also no priority check-in, or, indeed, priority anything. Boarding was a fiasco, with two lines directed into pens, pending the mad dash to the plane, which then entailed using a rather weird, tiered set of steps that was just another queue. Service in Club Europe commenced efficiently, but the cabin crew were of the breezy, cheery type who'd have been better suited to Ryanair. The brief drinks service over, it was on to the the much-vaunted, new look Club Europe meal service. Sadly, this proved to be just another cost-cutting, exercise, with everything piled on to the tiny plastic tray at once, and the appetiser and cheese 'courses' reduced to microscopic portions in little pots. And, of course, the seats haven't changed, although, interestingly, BA seem intent on packing ever more passengers into the Club Europe section, which means that the service is little different to the old economy. Still, we arrived only 30 minutes behind schedule and the priority tags did result in our bags coming off the belt within only a few minutes. It's just that the whole inflight experience is so lacklustre and un-business-like."
993,"✅ Trip Verified |  Chicago to London. I have flown long haul many times with both BA and Virgin premium economy. In my view whilst the Virgin product has improved, the BA equivalent has deteriorated such that Virgin is significantly better. Despite booking and paying for seats with BA this got changed without notification and we ended up in the back of WT+ on the A380 which are dreadful seats by the toilet with limited recline on an overnight flight. For the first time in many years I found the food inedible and the service not great (for example no cutlery initially on tray, no food choice as had run out of other choice, one drink serving and no where to get water on flight). Went through 3 layers of customer service with BA on seat booking issue but consistently fobbed off. Plane was also very warm so that in all a very uncomfortable return leg. "
994,"✅ Trip Verified |  Berlin to London. It was a connecting flight, so I should not complain. The flight was on time and the machine clean and? They do not serve free water, let alone tea or coffee. While this obviously costs nothing it testifies to the low perception of customers. BA simply turned into a low cost airline."
995,"✅ Trip Verified |  British Airways is my favorite airline. Boeing 777 was 21 years old but clean. The staff was professional. Food was above expectation. During 7 hours flight staff is always there. Captain kept updating us about weather, turbulence, and time. "
996,"✅ Trip Verified |  Rome to Newark via London. The first sector was on a A319. Flight was a tiny bit delayed but arrived on time. Boarding at FCO was initially by groups and then a free for all after groups 1 and 2. Flight attendants friendly and welcoming. Seat comfort was pretty good with the leather seats though legroom was tight. There was really nothing to set this flight apart from any other low cost carrier as everything had to purchased - even water. No entertainment either. Was prepared for this so packed a lunch from the airport which was better than what appeared to be on the M&S menu. Connection at T5 was smooth as anything given our arrival mid afternoon. Boarding for the flight to Newark was organised and painless. I was dreading this 787 flight a little based on my previous experience with another airline where it felt cramped. Happy to say, the seat comfort was pretty good, legroom was manageable. I was however surprised that for a 2 year old aircraft (i checked), it was pretty dirty. There was grime around the USB port (which didn't work), tv screen and along the floor by the wall. The cushion on the seatback in front appeared to be busting out the sides as well. I found the touchscreen IFE to be outdated and slightly slow in response. The selection was not as extensive but I did find some excellent British content that I had not seen before. The real standout was the cabin crew who were all somewhat senior but their experience shone through in just how consistently friendly, professional and warm they were with their service. They were generous with drinks and very efficient and quick. The main meal was decent though the pre arrival snack of sandwiches were a little dry and disappointing. All in all, a surprisingly good flight on the transatlantic leg in comparison to the sub par european sector."
997,"✅ Trip Verified |  London Heathrow to New York JFK. The First Wing at Terminal 5 was rubbish tonight, 20 or so deep and it’s really the only decent part of BA’s ground operation. Flight left late due to repairs then the usual wait for a tow in at Kennedy made us overall late. Staff very cheerful. This route gets decent catering normally but only 3 main options and the Indian chicken was very bland."
998,"Not Verified |  London Heathrow to Dubai. This was the first time I had flown in first class  on BA. I had read many reviews before travelling and they were somewhat mixed. BA's first class cabin is not even close to the best in the skies but then again it isn't the same price and reward tickets are readily available if you are a little bit flexible on dates. We were on a 777 which is probably one of the oldest in the BA fleet. The cabin was clean but a little bit tired in places but the seat was very comfortable and spacious. The sleep suit and amenity kit were great with lots of little touches to make you more comfy. It is nice they offer a male and female kit, my wife was delighted with the contents. The Champagne that BA offer in first is superb. I enjoyed a couple of glasses in the lounge and some on board and it is probably the best champagne I have tasted. Choice of other wines is good too and a particular treat is the Johnnie Walker Blue Label if you are a whiskey drinker. Food was very tasty and well presented. I had a seared prawn amuse bouche followed by poached baby pear with blue cheese and walnut brittle then Lamb Machboos as a main course and finally chocolate mille feuille. We were offered ice creams a hour or two later and then afternoon tea a couple of hours before landing. I cant really fault any of it. It was the best airline food i have ever eaten and better than a number of restaurant meals too. IFE was decent although the screen has to folded away so no entertainment during take off or landing,. I believe this has been rectified in later versions of this seat fitted to the 787. I do wish they had a full series of a show rather than just some random episodes but there was plenty of choice. The thing that really made this flight special were the cabin crew. From the moment we stepped on board until we deplaned they were fabulous. Attentive with out being over-bearing. Witty and charming but still professional and always available to attend to your every need. They were superb. Wifi was available but the page to connect didn't load up when i tried it. I dint really pursue it to be honest as i was happy to enjoy the other pleasures first had to offer. This was a great flight and i would wholly recommend that you try out first. Whether i would choose it over Club World would be on flight by flight basis. You have to do it once though!"
999,✅ Trip Verified |  Heraklion to Gatwick. Left my luggage behind on the belt by mistake. 30 mins after I realised I went back to the airport but no British Airways staff was willing to help. Asked me to ring a phone from the arrival hall pillar. Dialed for BA baggage enquiry and staff picked up the phone and hung up on purpose and never answered again. This is so frustrating.
