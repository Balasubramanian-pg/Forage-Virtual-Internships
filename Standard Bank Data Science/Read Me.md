## Project Overview

Standard Bank, Africa’s largest lender by assets, is embracing digital transformation to enhance customer experience by offering comprehensive services via mobile devices. The primary objective of this project is to streamline the home loan application process using machine learning to assess the creditworthiness of applicants in real-time, replacing the existing manual process that takes 2-3 days.

By implementing a predictive model, the bank aims to:
- **Reduce processing time:** Provide instant loan approval or rejection.
- **Improve accuracy:** Utilize data-driven insights to assess credit risk effectively.
- **Enhance customer satisfaction:** Offer a seamless and efficient loan application experience.
